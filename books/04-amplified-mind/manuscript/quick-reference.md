# The 6-Layer Protocol — Quick Reference

**One-page guide to The Amplified Mind framework**

---

## The Protocol

### Layer 1: Transmute (The Reframer)
**Time**: 5 minutes  
**Question**: What is the REAL problem beneath what was asked?  
**Action**: Reframe the question at a deeper level

### Layer 2: Multiply (The Council)
**Time**: 10 minutes  
**Question**: What do three different experts see?  
**Action**: Generate 3 expert perspectives (Execution, Strategy, Risk) and synthesize

### Layer 3: Evolve (The Challenger)
**Time**: 7 minutes  
**Question**: What's the strongest counterargument?  
**Action**: Steel-man opposition, strengthen your answer

### Layer 4: Crystallize (The Pattern Finder)
**Time**: 5 minutes  
**Question**: What pattern or principle emerges?  
**Action**: Extract transferable wisdom, identify mental model

### Layer 5: Transcend (The Transcender)
**Time**: 3 minutes  
**Question**: What do you now understand that you couldn't before?  
**Action**: Complete the recursion, find the next question

### Layer 6: Emerge (The Synthesizer)
**Time**: Variable  
**Question**: What insight emerged that wasn't in any single layer?  
**Action**: Find the synthesis, the third option

**Total Time**: ~30 minutes for full protocol

## Confidence Calibration

| Level | Range | Meaning | Action |
|-------|-------|---------|--------|
| **95%+** | Very High | I would bet significant money on this | Proceed with confidence |
| **80-95%** | High | Strong reasoning, few objections | Proceed, stay open to updates |
| **60-80%** | Moderate | More likely true than not | Proceed with caution |
| **<60%** | Low | Uncertain or speculative | Gather more info first |

## Epistemic Honesty Checks

Before making major claims, ask:

1. **What information don't I have?** — Acknowledge gaps
2. **What assumptions could be wrong?** — Challenge assumptions
3. **If I'm wrong, what's the failure mode?** — Consider consequences
4. **Am I pattern-matching or reasoning?** — Distinguish source of confidence

## When to Use Each Layer

**Use Full Protocol** (All 6 layers):
- High-stakes decisions
- Complex problems
- When you need deep understanding
- Before major commitments

**Use Selective Layers**:
- **Layer 1 (Transmute)**: When the question feels wrong
- **Layer 2 (Multiply)**: When you need broader perspective
- **Layer 3 (Evolve)**: When confidence feels too high
- **Layer 4 (Crystallize)**: When you want to learn broadly
- **Layer 5 (Transcend)**: When you need fresh perspective
- **Layer 6 (Emerge)**: When facing apparent trade-offs

## The Six Personas

1. **The Reframer** — Sees the real problem
2. **The Council** — Gathers expert perspectives
3. **The Challenger** — Steel-mans opposition
4. **The Pattern Finder** — Extracts principles
5. **The Transcender** — Sees meta-understanding
6. **The Synthesizer** — Finds the third option

## Quick Exercises

### 5-Minute Reframe
Take any question and ask: "What's the real problem here?" List 3 assumptions the question makes.

### 10-Minute Council
For any decision, answer from 3 perspectives: What would an executor see? A strategist? A risk analyst?

### 7-Minute Challenge
State your position. Generate the strongest counterargument. How does this strengthen your thinking?

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Skipping layers** — Each layer builds on the previous  
❌ **Rushing through** — Depth requires time  
❌ **Ignoring confidence calibration** — Uncalibrated confidence leads to poor decisions  
❌ **Skipping epistemic honesty** — Intellectual honesty is non-negotiable  
❌ **Using only one persona** — Multiple perspectives create richer understanding

---

## Success Indicators

✅ You reframe questions before answering  
✅ You seek multiple expert perspectives  
✅ You challenge your own thinking  
✅ You extract patterns and principles  
✅ You calibrate your confidence accurately  
✅ You find syntheses beyond apparent trade-offs
