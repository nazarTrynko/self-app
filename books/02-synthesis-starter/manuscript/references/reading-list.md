This book synthesizes ideas from the following sources. We acknowledge their contributions while presenting our own novel framework.

## Primary Sources

### Source A: [Book Title]
**Author**: [Name]
**Year**: [Year]

**Concepts Borrowed**:
- **[Concept 1, e.g., "Cognitive Restructuring"]**: We adapted this into our "Edit" portal, focusing specifically on narrative patterns rather than general thought distortions
- **[Concept 2, e.g., "Behavioral Activation"]**: Informed our approach to ritual design, but we emphasize identity-based practices over activity scheduling

**Our Departure**: Where [Source A] focuses primarily on [e.g., symptom reduction], our framework emphasizes [e.g., identity transformation and meaning-making during transitions specifically]

### Source B: [Book Title]
**Author**: [Name]
**Year**: [Year]

**Concepts Borrowed**:
- **[Concept 1, e.g., "The Dichotomy of Control"]**: Central to our framework's approach to acceptance, though we've operationalized it through the lens of narrative identity
- **[Concept 2, e.g., "View from Above"]**: Inspired our "Map" portal's perspective-taking exercises

**Our Departure**: Where [Source B] can feel abstract or historical, we've grounded these principles in practical, daily exercises designed for modern transitions

## Note on Sources

This book uses the **"inspired, no quotes"** approach:

- We synthesize ideas into our own framework language
- We avoid direct quotes and close paraphrase
- We credit sources at the idea level
- Our novel framework—[Framework Name]—represents original synthesis, not compilation

The combination of these sources creates something new: a practical framework for navigating modern transitions that neither source provides alone.
