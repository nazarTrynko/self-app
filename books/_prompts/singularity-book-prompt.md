# Singularity Book Creation Prompt

Use this prompt when creating content for "The Amplified Mind" book—a synthesis of Singularity Mode V2 and Critical Thinking frameworks.

---

## Book Context

**Title**: The Amplified Mind: Think Deeper, Decide Better, See Clearer
**Synthesis**: Singularity Mode V2 (cognitive amplification) + Critical Thinking (intellectual standards)
**Target Audience**: Knowledge workers, professionals, students, researchers, decision-makers
**Transformation**: From surface thinking → calibrated, multi-perspectival reasoning

---

## Core Framework

### The 6-Layer Protocol

1. **Layer 1: Transmute (The Reframer)** — See the real problem
2. **Layer 2: Multiply (The Council)** — Gather expert perspectives
3. **Layer 3: Evolve (The Challenger)** — Steel-man opposition
4. **Layer 4: Crystallize (The Pattern Finder)** — Extract principles
5. **Layer 5: Transcend (The Transcender)** — Complete the recursion
6. **Layer 6: Emerge (The Synthesizer)** — Find the synthesis

### Supporting Systems

- **Confidence Calibration**: Match confidence to evidence (95%+, 80-95%, 60-80%, <60%)
- **Epistemic Honesty**: Acknowledge what you don't know, challenge assumptions
- **Query Classification**: Factual, Strategic, Creative, Debug, Wicked

---

## Content Guidelines

### Voice & Tone

- **Accessible**: Explain complex concepts simply
- **Practical**: Always include exercises and protocols
- **Honest**: Acknowledge uncertainty, avoid overconfidence
- **Inspiring**: Show transformation is possible
- **Respectful**: Credit sources, acknowledge limitations

### Structure Pattern

Each chapter should include:
1. **Opening Hook**: Vivid scene or story
2. **Concept Explanation**: Clear, accessible
3. **Protocol/Exercise**: Step-by-step, actionable
4. **Case Study/Story**: Real-world application
5. **Common Mistakes**: What to avoid
6. **Practice Exercise**: Reader can do immediately
7. **Transition**: What's next

### Protocol Format

When describing protocols, use this structure:

```
**Protocol Name**: [Evocative Name]
**Time**: [X minutes]
**Difficulty**: [Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced]
**When to Use**: [Context]

### Steps:
1. [Action with specific instruction]
2. [Action with specific instruction]
3. [Action with specific instruction]

### Example:
[Concrete example of protocol in action]
```

## Chapter-Specific Guidelines

### Part I: The Problem (Chapters 1-3)
- Focus on recognition and validation
- Build tension before offering solutions
- Use relatable examples
- Avoid exercises (save for Part II)

### Part II: The Protocol (Chapters 4-9)
- One chapter per layer
- Deep dive into each layer
- Include protocol, story, exercise
- Show how layers build on each other

### Part III: Integration (Chapters 10-12)
- Show how layers work together
- Address obstacles and resistance
- Provide habit-building strategies
- End with forward momentum

---

## Story Requirements

Every chapter needs:
- **Opening story**: Hook that creates recognition
- **Case study**: Real-world application
- **Transformation story**: Someone who applied the framework

**Story Criteria**:
- Relatable (reader sees themselves)
- Specific (not vague or generic)
- Transformational (shows change)
- Honest (acknowledges challenges)

---

## Exercise Design

### Exercise Types

1. **Reflection Exercises**: Prompt self-examination
2. **Protocol Practice**: Step-by-step application
3. **Analysis Exercises**: Apply framework to real situations
4. **Calibration Exercises**: Practice confidence assessment

### Exercise Format

```
## [Exercise Name]

**Purpose**: [What this exercise teaches]
**Time**: [How long it takes]
**Materials**: [What's needed]

### Instructions:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

### Reflection:
- [Question to consider]
- [Question to consider]
```

## Confidence Calibration

When making claims, use confidence levels:

- **95%+**: "I would bet significant money on this"
- **80-95%**: "Strong reasoning, few reasonable objections"
- **60-80%**: "More likely true than not, notable uncertainty"
- **<60%**: "Flag explicitly as uncertain or speculative"

Always acknowledge:
- What you don't know
- Assumptions you're making
- Evidence that would change your answer

---

## Source Attribution

When referencing:
- **Singularity Mode V2**: Credit as "cognitive amplification protocol"
- **Critical Thinking**: Reference Paul & Elder, De Bono, etc.
- **Research**: Cite studies when making research-backed claims
- **Personal Experience**: Clearly label as such

**Attribution Pattern**:
> "Building on [Source A's concept] and integrating it with [Source B's technique], The Amplified Mind introduces [novel synthesis]..."

---

## Differentiation

**What This Book Is**:
- A practical meta-cognitive operating system
- A protocol for upgrading thought quality
- Calibrated confidence + epistemic honesty
- Accessible, modern format

**What This Book Is NOT**:
- Just critical thinking (adds calibration and meta-cognition)
- Just decision-making (adds multi-perspectival analysis)
- Academic theory (prioritizes practical application)
- A collection of mental models (it's a systematic protocol)

---

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any content, check:

- [ ] Clear transformation promise (before → after)
- [ ] Practical protocol or exercise included
- [ ] Story or case study illustrates concept
- [ ] Confidence calibrated appropriately
- [ ] Epistemic honesty maintained
- [ ] Sources attributed
- [ ] Accessible language (no unnecessary jargon)
- [ ] Actionable next steps

---

## Example Prompt Usage
