## Prompt for AI Assistance

When working with an AI to create your chapter outline:

```
I have a synthesis map for my book. Please help me convert it into a chapter outline.

## Synthesis Map Summary
- Framework Name: [Name]
- Synthesis Claim: [One sentence]
- Three Portals: [Portal 1], [Portal 2], [Portal 3]
- Target Audience: [Who]
- Transformation: [Before → After]

## Constraints
- Target word count: [X] words
- Target chapter count: [X] chapters
- Include [X] exercises per part
- Voice/tone: [Description]

Please generate:
1. A complete chapter outline following the Part I/II/III structure
2. Key points for each chapter
3. Suggestions for stories or case studies
4. Placement of exercises and tools
5. Transition sentences between chapters

The outline should flow naturally and build toward the transformation.
```

## Validation Checklist

Before moving to manuscript writing:

- [ ] Does the outline follow a clear arc (problem → framework → practice)?
- [ ] Is each chapter purpose distinct and necessary?
- [ ] Do the three portal chapters get roughly equal depth?
- [ ] Are exercises placed where readers need action, not just information?
- [ ] Does the opening hook in Chapter 1 grab immediately?
- [ ] Does the conclusion bring full circle to the opening?
- [ ] Is the word count realistic for the content?
- [ ] Have I identified all the stories I need?

---

## Next Steps

Once your outline is complete:

1. → Use `manuscript-style-guide.md` for writing voice and formatting
2. → Create chapter files in `manuscript/chapters/`
3. → Write one chapter at a time, in order
