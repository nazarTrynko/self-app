# Synthesis Map Prompt

## Purpose
Use this prompt to extract primitives from source materials and synthesize them into a novel framework. This is the foundational step before outlining chapters or building tools.

---

## The Synthesis Philosophy

Great synthesis is not compilation. It requires:

1. **Extraction** — Identify the core primitives (building blocks) from each source
2. **Tension** — Find where sources disagree or leave gaps
3. **Integration** — Combine primitives in ways the sources didn't
4. **Novelty** — Create something new that neither source contains alone

```
Source A Primitives + Source B Primitives + Tension Resolution = Novel Framework
```

---

## Source Handling Mode

**Default: "Inspired, No Quotes"**

- Synthesize ideas into your own framework language
- Avoid direct quotes and close paraphrase
- Credit sources at the idea level (not copy level)
- Your novel framework is original synthesis

**When Sources Allow Quotes:**
- Only quote if source is public domain, permissive, or you have permission
- Always attribute quotes explicitly
- Limit quotes to illustrative moments, not core content

## Synthesis Map Template

Use this template to create your synthesis map:

```markdown
# Synthesis Map: [Your Framework Name]

## The Synthesis Claim
This book synthesizes **[Source A]** and **[Source B]** to create [Novel Framework Name].

In one sentence: [What new capability or understanding does this synthesis enable?]

---

## Source A: [Title]
**Author**: [Name]
**Core Thesis**: [One sentence summary]

### Primitives (Core Building Blocks)
1. **[Primitive Name]**: [Description in your own words]
   - Key insight: [What this primitive reveals]
   - Limitation: [Where this primitive falls short]

2. **[Primitive Name]**: [Description in your own words]
   - Key insight: [What this primitive reveals]
   - Limitation: [Where this primitive falls short]

3. **[Primitive Name]**: [Description in your own words]
   - Key insight: [What this primitive reveals]

---

## Source B: [Title]
**Author**: [Name]
**Core Thesis**: [One sentence summary]

### Primitives (Core Building Blocks)
1. **[Primitive Name]**: [Description in your own words]

   - Limitation: [Where this primitive falls short]

2. **[Primitive Name]**: [Description in your own words]
   - Key insight: [What this primitive reveals]
   - Limitation: [Where this primitive falls short]

3. **[Primitive Name]**: [Description in your own words]
   - Key insight: [What this primitive reveals]
   - Limitation: [Where this primitive falls short]

### Source B's Blind Spots
- [What this source doesn't address]
- [Where its framework breaks down]
- [Questions it leaves unanswered]

---

## Tensions Between Sources

### Tension 1: [Name the tension]
- **Source A says**: [Position]
- **Source B says**: [Different position]
- **Resolution**: [How your synthesis resolves this]

### Tension 2: [Name the tension]
- **Source A says**: [Position]
- **Source B says**: [Different position]
- **Resolution**: [How your synthesis resolves this]

### Tension 3: [Name the tension]
- **Source A says**: [Position]
- **Source B says**: [Different position]
- **Resolution**: [How your synthesis resolves this]

---

## The Missing Piece

What neither source addresses that your synthesis provides:

**The Gap**: [Describe what's missing]

**Your Novel Contribution**: [What you bring that's new]

**Why This Matters**: [Impact of filling this gap]

---

## Novel Framework

### Framework Name: [Your Framework]

### Core Principle
[One paragraph describing the unified principle that emerges from synthesis]

### The Three Portals
Three approaches/lenses your framework offers:

1. **Portal 1: [Name]**
   - Draws from: [Which source primitives]
   - New element: [What you added]
   - Enables: [What this approach makes possible]

2. **Portal 2: [Name]**
   - Draws from: [Which source primitives]
   - New element: [What you added]
   - Enables: [What this approach makes possible]

3. **Portal 3: [Name]**
   - Draws from: [Which source primitives]
   - New element: [What you added]
   - Enables: [What this approach makes possible]

### The Prism Demo
The single interactive exercise that demonstrates the synthesis:

**Scenario**: [The situation users will explore]
**Lens A**: [First perspective] — from [Source A primitive]
**Lens B**: [Second perspective] — from [Source B primitive]
**Lens C**: [Integrated perspective] — your novel synthesis

**Insight**: [What toggling between lenses reveals]

### Key Terms
New vocabulary your framework introduces:
- **[Term]**: [Definition]
- **[Term]**: [Definition]
- **[Term]**: [Definition]

## Validation Questions

Before proceeding to chapters, verify:

- [ ] Can I explain the synthesis in one sentence?
- [ ] Is the novel framework genuinely new, not just compilation?
- [ ] Do the three portals offer distinct value?
- [ ] Does the prism demo create an "aha" moment?
- [ ] Have I avoided close paraphrase of source material?
- [ ] Would someone who read both sources still learn something new here?
```

## Example: Narrative Identity + NLP Synthesis

```markdown
# Synthesis Map: The Transition Rite

## The Synthesis Claim
This book synthesizes **Narrative Identity Theory** (McAdams) and **Neuro-Linguistic Programming** to create The Transition Rite framework.

In one sentence: By treating identity as an editable story (narrative) and providing practical rewriting tools (NLP), we enable intentional identity transition.

## Source A: Narrative Identity Theory
**Core Thesis**: Identity is the internalized, evolving story of the self.

### Primitives
1. **Life Story**: Identity as ongoing narrative
2. **Redemption/Contamination**: Story types that shape meaning
3. **Narrative Themes**: Recurring patterns (agency, communion)

### Blind Spots
- Describes stories but doesn't teach how to rewrite them
- Academic, not actionable
- Focuses on understanding, not transformation

## Source B: NLP
**Core Thesis**: Subjective experience can be repatterned through language and representation.

### Primitives
1. **Anchoring**: State-trigger associations
2. **Reframing**: Meaning transformation
3. **Timeline Work**: Temporal perspective shifts

### Blind Spots
- Techniques without narrative coherence
- Can feel mechanical, disconnected from meaning
- Lacks the "why" of identity

## The Missing Piece
Neither source bridges the gap between understanding your story and actively rewriting it with coherent techniques.

**Novel Contribution**: A structured ritual for identity transition that combines narrative awareness with practical transformation tools.

## Novel Framework: The Transition Rite

### The Three Portals
1. **The Map**: See your story clearly (narrative)
2. **The Edit**: Rewrite your story (techniques)
3. **The Ritual**: Embody the new story (integration)

### The Prism Demo
**Scenario**: "You didn't get the promotion you expected."
- **Victim Lens**: "They never valued me"
- **Growth Lens**: "This is redirecting me"
- **Author Lens**: "What story do I want to tell about this?"

**Insight**: You're not just experiencing events — you're authoring your response.

## Prompt for AI Assistance

When working with an AI to create your synthesis map:

```
I'm creating a synthesis map for a book that combines two sources.

Source A: [Title] by [Author]
- Main ideas: [Brief summary]
- Key concepts: [List 3-5]

Source B: [Title] by [Author]
- Main ideas: [Brief summary]
- Key concepts: [List 3-5]

My target audience: [Who]
My desired transformation: [Before → After]

Please help me:
1. Extract the core primitives from each source (in my own language, not quotes)
2. Identify tensions or gaps between them
3. Propose a novel framework that integrates both
4. Suggest a "prism demo" that shows the synthesis in action
5. Name three "portals" or approaches within the framework

Remember: Synthesize ideas, avoid close paraphrase, create something genuinely new.
```

## Next Steps

Once your synthesis map is complete:

1. → Use `chapter-outliner.md` to convert the map into chapters
2. → Use `series-scaler.md` to define landing page structure
3. → Use `tool-generator.md` to design reflection tools
