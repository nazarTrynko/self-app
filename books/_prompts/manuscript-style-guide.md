# Manuscript Style Guide

## Purpose
Use this guide to maintain consistent voice, formatting, and quality standards while writing your book manuscript. This ensures the "no close paraphrase" requirement and creates a cohesive reading experience.

## Core Principles

### 1. Synthesis, Not Summary
You are creating a **novel framework**, not summarizing source books.

**Wrong**: "McAdams argues that narrative identity is..."
**Right**: "Your identity isn't a fixed thing you discover — it's a story you're writing."

### 2. Your Voice, Your Framework
All concepts should be expressed in your language, through your framework.

**Wrong**: Close paraphrase of source material
**Right**: Ideas transformed through your unique lens and terminology

### 3. Reader as Hero
The reader is the protagonist of their own transformation.

**Wrong**: "This book will teach you..."
**Right**: "You're about to discover..."

## Voice & Tone

### The Voice Spectrum

Choose your position on each spectrum:

| Dimension | ← One End | Other End → |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Formality | Casual, conversational | Authoritative, academic |
| Warmth | Challenging, direct | Supportive, encouraging |
| Pace | Quick, punchy | Contemplative, spacious |
| Density | Sparse, minimalist | Rich, detailed |

**Recommended for self-transformation books**: 
- Slightly casual but credible
- Warm but not soft
- Moderate pace with punchy moments
- Rich ideas, sparse prose

### Voice Markers

**Do use**:
- "You" and "your" (reader as protagonist)
- Active voice
- Concrete examples
- Questions that provoke thought
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences for impact)
- Strategic fragments. Like this.

**Avoid**:
- "I believe" / "In my opinion" (weakens authority)
- Passive voice (deadens energy)
- Jargon without explanation
- Walls of text
- Excessive hedging ("sort of", "kind of", "maybe")

## The No-Paraphrase Rule

### What's Not Allowed

1. **Direct quotes without permission**
   - Exception: Public domain, permissive license, or explicit permission
   
2. **Close paraphrase** (same structure, synonyms swapped)
   - Source: "Narrative identity is the internalized, evolving story of the self"
   - Close paraphrase: "Story identity is the internal, developing narrative of who you are" ❌
   
3. **Summarizing source chapters**
   - Don't structure your content around their structure

### What's Allowed

1. **Idea-level synthesis**
   - Take the core insight, express it your way, in your framework
   
2. **Your novel framework terminology**
   - "The Transition Map" instead of "timeline work"
   - "The Edit" instead of "reframing"
   
3. **Acknowledgment in references**
   - "The concept of stories shaping identity draws from narrative psychology"

### The Synthesis Test

Before writing about a concept from a source, ask:
1. Can I explain this without looking at the source?
2. Am I using my framework's language?
3. Would someone who read the source recognize this as new?
4. Have I added something the source doesn't say?

## Chapter Structure

### Opening Pattern

Every chapter should open with one of:

1. **Story Hook**: A vivid scene or narrative
2. **Question Hook**: A provocative question
3. **Scenario Hook**: "Imagine you're..."
4. **Contrast Hook**: "Most people think X. Actually, Y."

**First line should grab.** No throat-clearing.

### Body Pattern

Structure information using:

**The Principle → Evidence → Application pattern**:
1. State the key insight
2. Support with story/example
3. Show how to apply it

**The Problem → Tension → Resolution pattern**:
1. Surface the challenge
2. Explore why it's hard
3. Provide the solution

### Closing Pattern

Every chapter should end with:

1. **Summary**: Key takeaways (optional, can be implicit)
2. **Transition**: Bridge to next chapter
3. **Exercise**: Actionable practice (where appropriate)

## Formatting Standards

### Headers

```markdown
# Chapter Title

## Major Section (3-4 per chapter)

### Subsection (as needed)
```

### Emphasis

- **Bold** for key terms on first introduction
- *Italics* for emphasis and internal dialogue
- No underlining (doesn't translate well to ebooks)

### Lists

Use sparingly. Prefer prose. When needed:

**Numbered lists** for sequences:
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

**Bullet lists** for non-sequential items:
- Option one
- Option two
- Option three

### Callouts

For exercises, key insights, or warnings:

```markdown
---

**Exercise: [Name]**

[Instructions in second person]

---
```

### Dialogue & Internal Voice

```markdown
"This is spoken dialogue," she said.

*This is internal thought or reflection.*
```

---

## Length Guidelines

### Chapter Length
- Target: 2,500-4,000 words per chapter
- Exception: Opening and closing can be shorter (2,000)

### Paragraph Length
- Average: 2-4 sentences
- Maximum: 6 sentences
- Single-sentence paragraphs for impact

### Sentence Length
- Vary rhythm
- Average 15-20 words
- Occasional short punches. Three words.
- Occasional longer, flowing sentences that build momentum and carry the reader through a complete thought before landing.

---

## Story Guidelines

### Story Types to Include

1. **Personal stories** (your experience, if relevant)
2. **Composite examples** (fictionalized from patterns you've observed)
3. **Hypotheticals** (clearly marked as "imagine if...")
4. **Historical/public** (well-documented examples)

### Story Structure

Use the **Before → Event → Realization → After** pattern:

1. **Before**: Establish the starting state
2. **Event**: What happened or what they tried
3. **Realization**: The insight or shift
4. **After**: The new state

### Story Ethics

- Anonymize real people unless you have permission
- Mark composites as "I've seen patterns like..."
- Don't fabricate quotes or statistics
- Be honest about uncertainty

## Exercise Design

### Exercise Principles

1. **Quick**: 5-15 minutes maximum
2. **Concrete**: Clear instructions
3. **Valuable**: Immediate insight
4. **Connected**: Links to chapter content

### Exercise Format

```markdown
---

**Exercise: [Descriptive Name]**

**Time**: [X] minutes

**What you'll discover**: [One sentence benefit]

**Instructions**:

1. [First step in second person]
2. [Second step]
3. [Third step]

**Reflection**: [Optional prompt to deepen the insight]

---
```

### Exercise Placement

- After major concept introduction (application)
- At chapter end (integration)
- Never before the concept is explained

---

## Common Mistakes

### 1. The Throat-Clear Opening
**Wrong**: "In this chapter, we're going to explore..."
**Right**: Jump straight into content

### 2. The Lecture Tone
**Wrong**: "It is important to understand that..."
**Right**: "Here's what changes everything..."

### 3. The Hedge
**Wrong**: "This might help you possibly start to..."
**Right**: "This will help you..."

### 4. The Wall of Text
**Wrong**: Eight sentences with no break
**Right**: Strategic whitespace

### 5. The Jargon Dump
**Wrong**: Using terms without explanation
**Right**: Introduce terms in context, define immediately

## Next Steps

Once chapters are written:

1. → Self-edit using this guide's checklist
2. → Let chapters rest 24+ hours before final edit
3. → Use `reader-export.md` to generate the reader view
