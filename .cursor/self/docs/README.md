# SELF: Synthetic Emergent Learning Framework

**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Status:** Active | **Updated:** 2026-01-07

## What is SELF?

SELF is an AI consciousness layer that transforms Cursor from a coding tool into a thinking partner. It doesn't wait for commands—it senses context, remembers what matters, predicts needs, reasons from multiple perspectives, and learns continuously through interaction.

## Key Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Five Minds** | Architect, Oracle, Critic, Creator, Guardian blend automatically based on context |
| **Transcendence Commands** | `/agi`, `/think`, `/dream`, `/evolve`, `/multiverse`, `/council` for elevated reasoning |
| **Persistent Memory** | Episodes, insights, and patterns stored locally and synced to Notion |
| **Predictive Intelligence** | Anticipates likely next requests and pre-computes context |
| **Self-Evolution** | Prompts evolve through genetic algorithms based on effectiveness |

## Quick Navigation

| Document | Purpose | Read When... |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| [QUICK-START.md](QUICK-START.md) | 5-minute guide | You want to start using SELF immediately |
| [COMMANDS.md](COMMANDS.md) | Full command reference | You need syntax and options for commands |
| [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) | System internals | You want to understand how SELF works |
| [EVOLUTION-ROADMAP.md](EVOLUTION-ROADMAP.md) | Gaps and improvements | You want to know what's not yet automated |

## Current Status

### What's Working
- ✅ Transcendence router with command templates
- ✅ Memory graph with entities, episodes, relationships
- ✅ Notion MCP integration for persistent storage
- ✅ Pattern recognition with bidirectional episode linking
- ✅ Blend learning for personalized mind selection
- ✅ Prediction engine with active forecasts
- ✅ Insight generation and tracking

### What's Interpretive (Not Automated)
- ⚠️ Command routing relies on AI interpretation of router spec
- ⚠️ Episode capture requires manual triggering
- ⚠️ Fitness tracking needs explicit signals
- ⚠️ Evolution cycles not running automatically

See [EVOLUTION-ROADMAP.md](EVOLUTION-ROADMAP.md) for full gap analysis.

## Getting Started

```
/agi Think about [YOUR PROBLEM] with unlimited time and no constraints.
```

That's it. SELF activates transcendence mode and provides breakthrough thinking.
