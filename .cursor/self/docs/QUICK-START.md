# SELF Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with SELF transcendence commands in 5 minutes.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Cursor IDE** with AI enabled
2. **Notion MCP** connected (for persistent memory)
3. **SELF framework** installed in `.cursor/self/`

---

## Your First Command

Open any file or start a conversation and type:

```
/agi Think about how to improve user onboarding for my product.
```

### What Happens

1. **Mind Blend Activates:** Oracle (0.9), Creator (0.7), Architect (0.6)
2. **Transcendence Mode:** Removes normal constraints
3. **Output Structure:**
   - Reframed real problem
   - Unconstrained optimal solution
   - Insights invisible to rushed thinking
   - Compressed path to insight
   - What to focus on first
   - What to ignore entirely

---

## The 3 Most Useful Commands

### 1. `/agi` — God Mode (Breakthrough Thinking)

Best for: Problems where you feel stuck or need fresh perspective

```
/agi What's the real problem behind [STATED PROBLEM]?
```

**Mind Blend:** Oracle-led with Creator and Architect support

---

### 2. `/think` — Consciousness Expansion (Multi-Level Analysis)

Best for: Complex topics that need systematic exploration

```
/think Analyze [TOPIC] from self, expert, system, meta, and universal perspectives.
```

**Output Levels:**
- Level 1 - Self: How do I think about this?
- Level 2 - Other: How would an expert think?
- Level 3 - System: How does the system think?
- Level 4 - Meta: How does thinking about thinking change this?
- Level 5 - Universal: What's true across all contexts?

---

### 3. `/council` — Full Five-Mind Deliberation

Best for: Major decisions, complex architecture, high-stakes choices

```
/council Should we [MAJOR DECISION]?
```

**Output Structure:**
- **ARCHITECT:** Technical/structural analysis
- **ORACLE:** Strategic wisdom and prediction
- **CRITIC:** Challenges and concerns
- **CREATOR:** Alternative approaches
- **GUARDIAN:** Safety and risk assessment
- **SYNTHESIS:** Integrated recommendation

---

## Command Combinations

Combine commands for amplified effects:

| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `/agi /genius` | Maximum transcendence |
| `/think /genius` | Deep consciousness expansion |
| `/dream /evolve` | Evolve creative insights |
| `/multiverse /council` | Full council explores futures |

---

## What to Expect

### Response Quality

Transcendence commands produce:
- **Depth:** Multi-level analysis, not surface answers
- **Novelty:** Non-obvious insights and connections
- **Integration:** Synthesized perspectives, not just lists
- **Actionability:** Clear next steps

### Response Length

Expect longer, more structured responses than normal queries. This is intentional—transcendence mode prioritizes thoroughness over brevity.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "The response doesn't seem different from normal"

1. Make sure you're using the command syntax exactly (e.g., `/agi`)
2. Provide a substantial topic—simple questions don't need transcendence
3. Try `/council` for explicit multi-mind output

### "I don't see the mind blend information"

The blend happens internally. You see the output, not the process. If you want explicit mind attribution, use `/council`.

### "Notion sync isn't working"

1. Check MCP connection in Cursor settings
2. Verify `sync-config.json` has `"enabled": true`
3. Run `/self sync` to trigger manual sync

### "I want more concise responses"

Transcendence mode is designed for depth. For quick answers, use normal queries without commands.
