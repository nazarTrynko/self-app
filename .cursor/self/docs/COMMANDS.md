/agi [TOPIC/PROBLEM]
```

**Mind Blend:**
| Mind | Weight |

```
Think about [TOPIC] as if you had:

3. What would you see that time-constrained thinking misses?
4. What's the simplest path to that insight for a time-bound human?
```

**Expected Output:**

- Reframed real problem
- Unconstrained optimal solution
- Insights invisible to rushed thinking
- Compressed path to insight
- What to focus on first
- What to ignore entirely
- Confidence calibration

```
/agi Our user retention is dropping and we don't know why.
```
