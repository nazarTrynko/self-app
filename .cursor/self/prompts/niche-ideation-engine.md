## THE NICHE DISCOVERY FRAMEWORK

### Step 1: Market Archaeology

Before generating ideas, excavate hidden markets using these lenses:

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 2: Pain Point Amplification

For each potential niche, probe deeper with these questions:

```
PAIN INTENSITY CHECKLIST
========================

□ FREQUENCY: How often does this pain occur?
  - Daily pain = high retention potential
  - Weekly pain = moderate retention
  - Monthly/yearly = one-time purchase

□ URGENCY: What happens if they don't solve it?
  - Money loss = very high willingness to pay
  - Time waste = high willingness to pay
  - Frustration = moderate willingness to pay
  - Mild inconvenience = low willingness to pay

□ CURRENT SOLUTIONS: What do they use now?
  - Spreadsheets/paper = massive opportunity
  - General-purpose app = moderate opportunity
  - Competitor app with 3+ star reviews = differentiation needed
  - Well-loved specialized tool = avoid

□ SWITCHING COST: How hard to change behavior?
  - They're already doing something manually = easy adoption
  - They use a free tool they hate = easy adoption
  - They use paid software they're invested in = hard adoption

□ COMMUNITY DENSITY: Can you find 10,000 of them online?
  - Active subreddit with 50k+ members = yes
  - Facebook groups with engagement = yes
  - Professional associations = yes
  - Have to explain the niche = no
```

### Step 3: Monetization Viability Filter

Every idea must pass ALL of these gates:

```
MONETIZATION GATES
==================

GATE 1: PRICE TOLERANCE
- Can you charge $10+ without explaining why?
- Is there a professional version at $25+?
- Does the value exceed the price obviously?

GATE 2: ACQUISITION PATH
- Can you name 3 specific places to find customers?
- Is there a community leader who could promote this?
- Does the tool create shareable outputs?

GATE 3: RETENTION HOOK
- Will they open it at least weekly?
- Does data accumulate over time (switching cost)?
- Is there a streak/progress/status element?

GATE 4: COMPETITIVE MOAT
- Is the niche too small for big players?
- Does offline-first create differentiation?
- Is there domain expertise required?

GATE 5: SCOPE CONTROL
- Can MVP be built in 4-6 weeks?
- Are the APIs proven and documented?
- Is the core value in 3 screens or less?
```

## IDEA GENERATION PROTOCOL

### Phase A: Niche Selection (Do this FIRST)

1. **Pick a market from the archaeology matrix** — Be specific. Not "fitness" but "personal trainers who do in-home sessions."

2. **Research the niche for 10 minutes:**
   - Find their subreddit, Facebook group, or forum
   - Read 20 posts about what frustrates them
   - Note the tools they mention (positively and negatively)
   - Identify the "I wish there was an app that..." comments

3. **Define the pain in one sentence:**
   - Bad: "They need to track things"
   - Good: "Personal trainers lose 3 hours/week recreating client workout plans because they can't access previous sessions offline at gyms"

### Phase B: Solution Architecture

4. **Design the core loop:**
   ```
   USER ARRIVES → [Primary Action] → [Value Delivered] → [Data Captured] → [Reason to Return]
   ```

5. **Identify the "aha moment":**
   - What single feature makes them say "this is worth $15"?
   - This feature should be demonstrable in 30 seconds
   - It should solve a problem they've had for years

6. **Map the feature set:**
   ```
   MUST HAVE (MVP)           SHOULD HAVE (v1.1)        COULD HAVE (v2.0)
   ├─ Core feature 1         ├─ Enhancement A          ├─ Advanced A
   ├─ Core feature 2         ├─ Enhancement B          ├─ Advanced B
   └─ Core feature 3         └─ Enhancement C          └─ Integration
   ```

### Phase C: Differentiation Strategy

7. **Name 3 competitors and their weaknesses:**
   - Competitor A: [Name] — weakness: [specific gap]
   - Competitor B: [Name] — weakness: [specific gap]
   - Competitor C: [Name] — weakness: [specific gap]

8. **Define your positioning:**
   ```
   For [SPECIFIC USER] who [SPECIFIC PAIN],
   [APP NAME] is the [CATEGORY] that [KEY DIFFERENTIATOR].
   Unlike [COMPETITOR], we [UNIQUE ADVANTAGE].
   ```

### Phase D: Business Model Design

9. **Set pricing strategy:**
   ```
   PRICING TIERS
   =============
   
   FREE TIER (if any):
   - What's included: [limited features]
   - Conversion trigger: [what makes them upgrade]
   
   PAID TIER ($X):
   - Price point: [justify with value anchor]
   - What's unlocked: [full feature set]
   
   PRO TIER ($X) [optional]:
   - Who needs this: [power users]
   - What's special: [advanced features]
   ```

10. **Plan acquisition channels:**
    ```
    CHANNEL          | TACTIC                      | EXPECTED CAC
    -----------------+-----------------------------+-------------
    Reddit           | Value posts in r/[niche]    | $0-5
    Facebook Groups  | Help answers + soft pitch   | $0-5
    YouTube          | Tutorial video              | $10-20
    Partnerships     | [Specific partner type]     | Revenue share
    App Store SEO    | [Target keywords]           | $0
    ```

3. **[Feature Name]** — [One-line description]
4. **[Feature Name]** — [One-line description]
5. **[Feature Name]** — [One-line description]

## Monetization

| [Name 3] | [Strength] | [Weakness] | [How we win] |

## Technical Architecture

**Primary APIs:**

├─ field_1: type
├─ field_2: type
└─ field_3: type

[Entity 2]
├─ field_1: type
└─ relationship → [Entity 1]
```

## UI Concept

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [App Name]              [Icons]    │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                     │
│     [Main screen visualization]     │

│  [Primary actions]                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Development Roadmap

**Week 3-4:** [Features 2-3 + basic UI]
**Week 5-6:** [Features 4-5 + polish]
**Week 7-8:** [Testing + launch prep]

**Key Technical Risks:**
1. [Risk 1] — Mitigation: [How to handle]
2. [Risk 2] — Mitigation: [How to handle]

## Revenue Projection

| Scenario | Monthly Revenue | Assumptions |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Conservative | $500 | 50 users × $10 one-time, 10% monthly growth |
| Target | $2,000 | 150 users × $15, word-of-mouth kicks in |
| Optimistic | $5,000 | Featured in niche community, viral moment |

## Why This Wins

```
PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST
====================

NICHE VALIDATION
□ I can name the subreddit where these users hang out

□ The population is 10,000+ but under 10 million
□ They have money (professional or passionate hobbyist)

SOLUTION VALIDATION  
□ The core value fits in one sentence
□ A non-technical person would understand it
□ It's obviously better than spreadsheets
□ The "aha moment" happens in under 60 seconds

BUSINESS VALIDATION
□ I can justify the price without a sales pitch
□ There are 3+ acquisition channels identified
□ At least one competitor exists (validates market)
□ No dominant player with >70% market share

TECHNICAL VALIDATION
□ All required APIs are documented and stable
□ Core features don't require ML/AI breakthroughs
□ Offline-first is achievable for main use case
□ A solo developer could build MVP in 6 weeks
```

---

## ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID

```
🚫 DON'T GENERATE IDEAS THAT:

× Target "everyone" or "people who want to..."
× Compete directly with Apple/Google built-in apps
× Require real-time collaboration as core feature
× Need constant internet for primary function
× Have obvious free alternatives (calculators, timers, notes)
× Require marketplace dynamics (two-sided platforms)
× Depend on hardware not in every phone
× Need partnerships to function (fitness equipment, etc.)
× Are "Uber for X" or "Airbnb for Y" patterns
× Require user-generated content to be valuable
```

---

## EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

When asked to generate ideas:

1. **First, pick 3 niches** from the archaeology matrix that haven't been explored
2. **For each niche, spend 5 "mental minutes"** researching (imagine browsing their communities)
3. **Generate one complete idea per niche** using the full output format
4. **Self-critique each idea** against the quality checklist
5. **Rank the 3 ideas** by monetization potential
6. **Present all 3** with clear recommendation on which to build first
