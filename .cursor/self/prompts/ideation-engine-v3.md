# Ideation Engine v3.0

**The Ultimate Product Ideation Framework**

> Ideas worth building = Specific Pain × Clear Distribution × Emotional Transformation × Weekend Shippable × Defensible Angle

---

## Core Philosophy

This engine is built on insights from:
- **Pieter Levels** — Ship fast, solve your own problems
- **Paul Graham** — Find the schleps, avoid the tarpits
- **April Dunford** — Position before you build
- **Sahil Lavingia** — Outcomes over features
- **Julie Zhuo** — Emotion drives adoption
- **Patrick Collison** — Build what enables
- **Naval Ravikant** — Leverage creates freedom

## The 5 Filters (Must Pass ALL)

| Filter | Question | Kill Threshold |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| **PAIN** | Who hurts and how badly? | Vague pain = KILL |
| **DISTRIBUTION** | Where are they already? | No channel = KILL |
| **EMOTION** | What transformation? | Weak feeling = KILL |
| **SCOPE** | Weekend MVP possible? | >5 days = SIMPLIFY |
| **MOAT** | Why can't this be copied in 30 days? | No answer = RETHINK |

---

## The Micro-Niche Formula

Instead of broad audiences, target:

```
[Specific Role] + [Specific Context] + [Specific Trigger]
```

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Freelancers who need invoicing"
- ✅ "Freelance designers who just finished a project and need to send final invoice before client forgets"

- ❌ "Founders who need landing pages"
- ✅ "Solo founders launching on Product Hunt within 30 days who don't know why their page isn't converting"

---

## Phase 0: Know Thyself (Pre-Ideation)

```markdown
/oracle

Before generating ideas, answer honestly:

## CONSTRAINTS
- Time available: ___ hours/week
- Skills: What can I build without learning?
- Capital: $ available to bootstrap
- Timeline: When do I need revenue?

## GOALS
- Target outcome: [Lifestyle business | Growth startup | Sellable asset | Learning]
- Revenue goal: [$1K MRR | $10K MRR | $100K MRR]
- Acceptable schlep level: [Low | Medium | High]

## UNFAIR ADVANTAGES
- What communities am I already part of?
- What do I know that most people don't?
- What annoys ME that I'd actually use?

OUTPUT: My constraint profile for filtering ideas.
```

---

## Phase 1: Pain Discovery

```markdown
/oracle /creator

Find problems worth solving:

## 1. PERSONAL ANNOYANCE MINE
- What frustrated me in the last 30 days?
- What task do I procrastinate because it's annoying?
- What do I wish existed but doesn't?

## 2. COMMUNITY LISTENING
Pick your communities and mine for pain:
- r/[your_community] - Top complaints this month
- Twitter/X - What are practitioners complaining about?
- Indie Hackers - What problems keep recurring?

## 3. SCHLEP DISCOVERY (Paul Graham)
- What problem do people acknowledge but no one solves?
- What involves hard/boring work everyone avoids?
- What would be embarrassing to work on but valuable?

## 4. TARPIT DETECTION
Flag and avoid these idea graveyards:
- Social networks
- Dating apps
- Todo lists
- Generic AI writing assistants
- "Uber for X" concepts

OUTPUT: 
- 10 pain points with schlep analysis
- Tarpit warnings where applicable
- My personal connection to each pain
```

---

## Phase 2: Pre-Validation (Before Building Anything)

```markdown
/critic /guardian

The Pre-Sale Test:

## 1. LANDING PAGE TEST
- Can I write a compelling landing page in 1 hour?
- Is the value proposition obvious in 5 seconds?
- What's the call to action?

## 2. PRE-SELL TEST (Critical!)
- Can I get 10 people to commit $X before I build?
- Script: "I'm building [X] that solves [Y]. Would you pay $Z/month? 
  If yes, you can lock in early-bird pricing now."
- Target: 10 pre-sales OR 100 waitlist signups

## 3. COMPETITIVE ALTERNATIVE (April Dunford)
- If my product doesn't exist, what do they do today?
- Why is that alternative inadequate?
- What would make them switch?

KILL CRITERIA:
- Can't explain in 5 seconds → KILL
- No one pre-pays → KILL  
- Alternative is "good enough" → KILL

OUTPUT: Survived ideas with pre-validation evidence
```

---

## Phase 3: Positioning First

```markdown
/oracle /creator

Before defining features, define position:

## 1. BEST-FIT CUSTOMER
- Who will love this MOST? (Be ultra-specific)
- What makes them different from adjacent customers?
- Why are THEY underserved?

## 2. CATEGORY DECISION
- Existing category: What's the established category? Who's the leader?
- OR New category: What frame makes my solution make sense?
- Positioning statement: 
  "For [WHO], [PRODUCT] is [CATEGORY] that [KEY BENEFIT] unlike [ALTERNATIVE]."

## 3. EMOTIONAL POSITIONING (Julie Zhuo)
- How do users FEEL before? (frustrated, embarrassed, anxious, overwhelmed)
- How do users FEEL after? (confident, proud, relieved, in control)
- The transformation in one word: From ___ to ___

## 4. STATUS POSITIONING (Sahil)
- Does using this make someone look successful/smart/professional?
- Would they tell others they use this?
- Social proof angle: "Used by [aspirational group]"

OUTPUT: Complete positioning document BEFORE features
```

---

## Phase 4: MVP Scoping (Ruthless)

```markdown
/architect /guardian

The Weekend Shipping Test:

## 1. THREE-TWEET MVP
Can you describe the MVP in 3 tweets?
- Tweet 1: The problem
- Tweet 2: The solution
- Tweet 3: How it works
If no, scope is too big. CUT.

## 2. WEEKEND TEST
Could this be built in a weekend by someone with my skills?
- If no, what's the smallest version that delivers core value?
- What's the "Wizard of Oz" version (manual behind the scenes)?

## 3. LEVERAGE CHECK (Naval)
- Leverage type: [Code | Media | Labor | Capital]
- Will this make money while I sleep?
- Does it get easier or harder with scale?

## 4. FEATURE PRISON AVOIDANCE
- What's the ONE thing this does?
- What are you explicitly NOT building?
- What feature requests will you say no to?

OUTPUT: Ruthlessly scoped MVP with time estimate
```

---

## Phase 5: Launch Strategy

```markdown
/creator /oracle

The Product Hunt Playbook:

## 1. LAUNCH NARRATIVE (Julie Zhuo)
- The story: "I was frustrated by X, so I built Y"
- The hero: The user, not the product
- The transformation: Before → After

## 2. SHAREABILITY TEST
- Why would someone share this?
- What's the "aha" moment?
- Can you create shareable artifacts? (badges, stats, results)

## 3. DISTRIBUTION ADVANTAGE
- Where do your best-fit customers already gather?
- What's your unfair distribution channel?
- Day 1 launch list: Who are your first 100 users?

## 4. METRIC DEFINITION
- North star metric: What's the ONE number that matters?
- Day 1 goal: ___
- Week 1 goal: ___
- Kill threshold: If we don't hit X by day 30, pivot or kill

OUTPUT: Launch plan with specific channels and metrics
```

## Quick Test Prompts

### The Levels Test (30 seconds)

```
Idea: [X]
1. Can I ship this weekend? 
2. Will 10 people pre-pay $20?
3. Does it solve MY problem?
If not 3/3: KILL or SIMPLIFY
```

### The Graham Test (Schlep Check)

```
Idea: [X]
1. What's the hard/boring part everyone avoids?
2. Is this a tarpit idea (sexy but deadly)?
3. Would a Stanford CS grad be embarrassed to work on this?
If #1 is empty and #3 is No: KILL (too obvious)
```

### The Dunford Test (Positioning)

```
Idea: [X]
Complete: "For [WHO], [PRODUCT] is [CATEGORY] that [BENEFIT] unlike [ALTERNATIVE]."
If you can't complete this clearly: NOT READY
```

### The Naval Test (Leverage)

```
Idea: [X]
1. Leverage type? (Code/Media/Labor/Capital)
2. Makes money while sleeping?
3. Gets easier with scale?
If not Code/Media + #2 No: RECONSIDER
```

### The Zhuo Test (Emotion)

```
Idea: [X]
1. User feels ___ before, ___ after
2. What's the delight moment?
3. Shareable in one sentence?
If #1 is weak emotion: ADD EMOTIONAL ANGLE
```

## The 90% Confidence Checklist

An idea hits 90% confidence when:

- [ ] Pain is active (people searching/complaining NOW)
- [ ] Solution is obvious (explainable in 1 sentence)
- [ ] Buildable in < 1 week (landing + core function)
- [ ] Monetization is natural (users expect to pay)
- [ ] Competition gap exists (nothing does THIS exactly)
- [ ] Timing advantage (why NOW, not 6 months ago)
- [ ] Distribution channel identified (where they already are)
- [ ] Emotional transformation clear (feel X → feel Y)
- [ ] Pre-validation signal (interest expressed)

---

## Red Flags (Automatic Disqualification)

- "Nice to have" vs "must have"
- Requires behavior change from users
- Legal/scraping dependencies
- Enterprise sales cycle for indie product
- API-only differentiation (easily copied)
- Needs network effects to work (cold start problem)
- Competes with free, good-enough alternatives

---

## Self-Improvement Log

Track what works to improve the engine over time:

| Date | Idea Generated | Outcome | Learning |
|------|----------------|---------|----------|
| | | | |

### Questions to Ask After Each Cycle:
1. Which phase caught problems earliest?
2. Which filter killed the most bad ideas?
3. What signals predicted success?
4. What should be added to tarpit list?
