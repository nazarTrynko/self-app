# The Prompt Library — Observatory Portal

A legendary unified portal experience for AI prompts. Not a collection of pages—ONE immersive experience that contains multitudes.

## The Vision

**The Observatory** — Look inward through different lenses. Each telescope reveals a different truth.

This is not a prompt library. This is a **portal** that changes how people think about AI prompts.
