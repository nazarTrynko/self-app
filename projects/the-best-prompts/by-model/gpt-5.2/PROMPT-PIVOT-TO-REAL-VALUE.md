# PIVOT TO REAL VALUE (When an idea feels hollow)

Use this when you (or the user) says: “I don’t like this. It has no value. Create something real.”

We need to pivot. The current idea feels hollow: it optimizes for distribution (SEO/virality) instead of genuine user value.

## 1) DEFINE “REAL VALUE” (no hand-waving)
Answer in 1–2 sentences each:
- Who is the user (be specific)?
- What recurring painful moment do they experience weekly?
- What’s the cost of that pain (time, money, reputation, emotional)?
- What does “a great outcome” look like in one session?

## 2) STOP BUILDING FEATURES; FIND THE CORE JOB
Write the “job to be done”:
“When I am _____, I want to _____, so I can _____.”

List 3 competing alternatives the user already uses (even if they’re bad).

## 3) GENERATE 10 “REAL VALUE” PRODUCT CONCEPTS
Constraints:
- Must deliver value in under 60 seconds (first-use win).
- Must have a clear wedge (one job, one user).
- Must be demonstrable without integrations.

For each concept include:
- Name + one-line promise
- Target user + use case
- What it replaces
- What the user gets in 60 seconds
- One “why this is shareable” mechanic

## 4) PICK ONE WEDGE
Choose the concept with the best combo of:
- Pain intensity
- Speed-to-value
- Differentiation
- Distribution channel fit

## 5) DESIGN THE MVP EXPERIMENT (2 weeks)
Define:
- The single core flow (3–5 steps)
- One metric that proves value (not vanity)
- A fallback if it fails

## 6) GUARDIAN CHECK
List:
- Safety / ethical risks
- Legal risks
- What NOT to build (explicitly)

## OUTPUT FORMAT
### Verdict
### 10 Concepts (ranked)
### The Wedge (why it wins)
### MVP Experiment
### What we will NOT build
### One question to sit with
