## VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS

**Before building ANY page, validate:**

```
□ Keyword research (Ahrefs/SEMrush actual data)
  → Confirm search volumes match estimates

□ SERP analysis (who ranks #1-10 for target keywords)
  → Can we create something 10x better?

□ User interviews (5-10 people in target audience)
  → Do they actually have this pain?
  → Would they use these prompts/tools?

□ Competition audit (what exists, what's missing)
  → Map exact gaps we're filling

□ Tool demand validation (search for "[topic] calculator")
  → Do people want interactive tools?
```

**Current Status:** All ⬜ (not yet validated with live data)

**Priority:** Validate Decision-Making niche FIRST before building

## CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION

### What We're Confident About (80%+):

- ✅ Top 5 niches have genuine demand
- ✅ Decision-making is underserved (manual search confirms)
- ✅ Interactive tools create differentiation
- ✅ Beautiful design drives shareability
- ✅ Architecture is production-ready

### What Requires Validation (< 60%):

- ⬜ Exact search volumes
- ⬜ Ranking difficulty (can we actually rank?)
- ⬜ Tool engagement rates
- ⬜ Monetization conversion rates
- ⬜ Time to achieve targets

### What Would Change Our Strategy:

- Keyword data shows much lower volumes → focus on higher-volume niches
- User interviews reveal different pain points → pivot messaging
- SERP analysis shows we can't compete → choose different niches
- Large competitor launches similar site → accelerate timeline

## COUNCIL INSIGHTS

### Architect

**Priority:** Stick to the architecture. It's designed for scale.  
**Warning:** Don't over-engineer. Ship MVP first, optimize later.

### Oracle

**Priority:** Validate assumptions BEFORE building.  
**Opportunity:** Annual Review is the hidden gem. Don't sleep on it.

### Critic

**Priority:** Test the Decision-Making niche hypothesis.  
**Challenge:** "Low search volume" might mean "no demand." Prove otherwise.

### Creator

**Priority:** Make each landing visually distinctive.  
**Opportunity:** Tools are our secret weapon. Make them screenshot-worthy.

### Guardian

**Priority:** Get legal review before launching Therapy prompts.  
**Warning:** Don't compromise quality for speed. Reputation is fragile.
