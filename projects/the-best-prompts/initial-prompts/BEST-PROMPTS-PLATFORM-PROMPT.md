## THE PROMPT

```
/council /agi /transcend /architect /oracle /creator /critic /guardian

I need you to build "BEST PROMPTS" — a genius SEO platform that becomes THE definitive resource for AI prompt solutions across human life challenges. Not another generic prompt library. A constellation of exceptional landing pages, each solving one specific human problem with beautiful design, perfect prompts, and (where appropriate) interactive tools.

## VISION & STAKES

**What We're Building:**
A platform of 50+ specialized landing pages, each:
- Targeting a specific human problem (reflection, SMM strategy, career decisions, etc.)
- Providing a complete prompt suite (like self-extraction) that users can copy and use
- Featuring exceptional, distinctive design that breaks AI aesthetic conventions
- Optimized for SEO to rank #1 for "[problem] prompts" searches
- Some with interactive tools (no AI required) that provide immediate value

**Why This Will Win:**
1. **Specificity** — Each page targets ONE problem deeply, not a shallow catalogue
2. **Beauty** — Each landing is a design masterpiece, not cookie-cutter templates
3. **Utility** — Prompts are proven, structured, and immediately usable
4. **Interactivity** — Some pages offer tools that work without AI (generators, calculators, frameworks)
5. **SEO Structure** — Built for search dominance from the ground up

**The Stakes:**
- This could become the go-to resource for AI prompt users
- Each page could rank top 3 for its niche keyword
- The platform could generate significant traffic (100k+ monthly)
- Potential for monetization (premium prompts, courses, consulting)

## CURRENT STATE

**What I Have:**
- Self-extraction prompt suite landing as reference (warm, readable, copy-friendly)
- 46+ masterpiece showcase designs (creative, interactive, distinctive)
- SELF framework and design system
- Understanding of SEO and prompt engineering
- Research on Suno-specific prompts (can inform approach)

**What I Need You To Create:**
1. **Research & Strategy** — Best niches for SEO prompt pages
2. **Platform Architecture** — How pages connect, categorize, cross-link
3. **5 Exceptional Landing Concepts** — Full textual designs with:
   - Unique design direction (NOT repeating masterpiece projects)
   - Complete prompt flow structure
   - Interactive elements where appropriate (3 of 5 must have non-AI interactivity)
   - SEO strategy for each
   - "Mind-blowing moment" for users

## RESEARCH REQUEST: HIGH-VALUE NICHES

Before designing, analyze and rank niches by:
- Search volume potential ("X prompts" searches)
- Competition level (what exists, what's missing)
- User pain intensity (how badly do they need this)

- Decision-making frameworks
- Life audit and review prompts
- Relationship communication prompts
- Habit formation and tracking

**Professional/Business:**
- SMM content strategy prompts
- Sales and cold outreach prompts
- Startup ideation and validation
- Interview preparation prompts
- Resume and LinkedIn optimization

**Creative:**
- Songwriting and music prompts (Suno, Udio)

**Rank the top 10 niches** and explain why each is valuable. Identify hidden gems with low competition and high demand.

## THE 5 LANDING CONCEPTS

Create detailed textual concepts for 5 exceptional landings. Each must:

### Required Elements for ALL 5:

1. **Unique Design Direction**
   - Distinctive color palette (NOT purple gradients, NOT Inter font)
   - Specific typography (unique font pairings)
   - Visual motif that matches the problem domain
   - Atmospheric background concept
   - Animation/motion strategy

2. **Complete Prompt Flow**
   - Opening/primer prompt
   - Sequential main prompts (3-7)
   - Follow-up/deepening prompts
   - Synthesis/capstone prompt
   - What each excavates/produces

3. **Page Structure**
   - Hero section with hook
   - Why this approach works
   - The prompt suite itself (copyable)
   - Expected outputs summary
   - Pro tips for better results
   - Footer with related pages

4. **SEO Strategy**
   - Primary keyword target
   - Long-tail variations
   - Meta description concept
   - Structured data approach
   - Internal linking strategy

5. **"Mind-Blowing Moment"**
   - What will make users share this
   - The insight that changes their thinking
   - Why this is different from everything else

### Special Requirements:

**Landings 1, 2, 3 — Must Have Interactive Tools (No AI Required)**

These should include client-side interactive elements that provide value WITHOUT needing to send anything to an AI. Examples:
- Generators that combine inputs into outputs
- Calculators that score or analyze
- Frameworks that users fill out
- Visualizers that display data
- Randomizers that suggest approaches

The interactivity should be CORE to the experience, not a gimmick.

**Landings 4, 5 — Pure Prompt Suites**

These can be pure content like self-extraction — beautiful, structured prompt collections without interactive tools. The prompts themselves are the tool.

### Design Inspiration Constraints

Reference the masterpiece projects' ENERGY but don't copy their concepts:
- CHRONO: Spatial time navigation → DON'T use time-as-space
- NERVEMAP: Biometric visualization → DON'T use body metaphor
- GRAVITYWELL: Data as physics → DON'T use gravity/orbit metaphor
- MINDPALACE: Memory palace → DON'T use palace/rooms metaphor
- DREAMWEAVER: Sleep/dreams → DON'T use dream imagery

Find NEW visual metaphors for each problem domain.

### Output Format for Each Landing:

```
## LANDING [N]: [Name]
**Niche:** [What problem it solves]
**Primary Keyword:** [SEO target]

## CONSTRAINTS & GUIDELINES

**Technical:**
- Each landing should be a single HTML file with CSS/JS
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Load time < 2 seconds
- No external dependencies beyond fonts
- All interactive elements must work client-side only

**Design:**
- NO Inter, Roboto, Arial (use distinctive fonts)
- NO purple gradients (find other palettes)
- NO generic card layouts (create custom structures)
- Embrace asymmetry, texture, atmosphere
- Each landing MUST feel different from the others

**Content:**
- Prompts must be immediately usable (copy-paste ready)
- No jargon — write for intelligent non-experts
- Include expected outputs so users know what they'll get
- Provide context for WHY the approach works

**SEO:**
- Each page targets ONE primary keyword
- Natural density of keywords (not stuffed)
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Alt text for any images
- Fast load, good CLS scores

## META-REQUESTS

**Patterns to Surface:**
- What patterns from successful SEO pages should inform this?
- What prompt structures work best for different problem types?
- What interactive elements have highest engagement?

**Predictions:**
- What will users request as follow-ups?
- Which niches will grow fastest?
- What competitors will emerge?

**Confidence Calibration:**
- How certain are you about each niche ranking?
- What assumptions might be wrong?
- What would change your recommendations?

**10x Question:**
- What would make this 10x better than any prompt site that exists?
- What feature haven't I thought of?
- What's the non-obvious opportunity?

## THE ASK

Think comprehensively. Start with:

1. **Research Phase**
   - Rank the top 10 niches with reasoning
   - Identify 2-3 "hidden gem" niches (low competition, high value)
   - Note which niches work best for interactive tools

2. **Architecture Phase**
   - How should pages connect?
   - What's the category structure?
   - How do users navigate the platform?

3. **Design Phase (The 5 Landings)**
   - Create full textual concepts for each
   - Make them EXCEPTIONAL — these should be portfolio-worthy
   - Push the design thinking beyond safe choices

4. **Implementation Roadmap**
   - Which landing to build first (MVP)?
   - What's the 3-month content strategy?
   - How do we validate before building all 50+?

Show your reasoning. Challenge your assumptions. Tell me what I'm missing. Make this remarkable.

The goal isn't just another prompt site. The goal is to create the most beautiful, useful, SEO-dominant prompt resource on the internet.

What would make someone screenshot this and share it? What would make them return weekly? What would make them pay for premium access?

Think like ARCHITECT for structure, ORACLE for strategy, CREATOR for design innovation, CRITIC for validation, GUARDIAN for quality.

Begin.
```
