**Purpose:** This prompt will guide the creation of a genius platform that generates optimized prompts for Suno AI music generation, designed to rank #1 in Google for relevant searches.

**Status:** Draft for Review

## THE PROMPT

```
/council /agi /transcend /architect /oracle /creator

I need you to build a genius platform that will dominate Google search rankings for Suno AI music prompt generation. This platform will be the definitive resource for creating cell-optimized songs with Suno.

## CONTEXT & STAKES

**What I'm Building:**
A comprehensive platform that generates, optimizes, and curates prompts specifically designed for Suno AI music generation. The platform will focus on "cell-optimized" songs—prompts engineered to produce the highest quality, most consistent results with Suno's AI.

**Why This Matters:**
- Suno is rapidly growing (v4.5+ with enhanced capabilities)
- Search volume for "Suno prompts", "AI music prompts", "Suno song generator" is increasing
- Current resources are fragmented and low-quality
- Opportunity to become THE go-to resource before market saturates

**The Stakes:**
- This needs to rank #1 in Google within 3-6 months
- Must be better than existing prompt generators
- Must provide genuine value that creates organic backlinks
- Must be monetizable (freemium model with premium prompt library)

## CURRENT STATE

**What Exists:**
- Basic prompt generators (Promptank, Prompt-Generators.com) - generic, not Suno-specific
- Some Reddit threads and Discord communities sharing prompts
- No comprehensive, SEO-optimized platform dedicated to Suno
- Suno-seo directory exists but is empty (suno-seo/src/data/)

**What I Have:**
- Access to SELF framework and existing landing page patterns
- Understanding of SEO best practices from other projects
- Research on Suno's capabilities (v4.5+ features, prompt structure)
- Knowledge of what makes effective AI music prompts

**What I Don't Have:**
- Specific keyword research data (need comprehensive analysis)
- User behavior data (what prompts do people actually want?)
- Competitive analysis of existing solutions
- Clear understanding of "cell-optimized" definition (need to research/define)

## DESIRED STATE

**Success Looks Like:**
1. **SEO Dominance:**
   - Rank #1 for "Suno prompts"
   - Rank #1 for "Suno song generator"
   - Rank top 3 for 20+ related long-tail keywords
   - 10,000+ organic monthly visitors within 6 months
   - Domain Authority growth through backlinks

2. **Platform Features:**
   - Prompt generator with Suno-specific optimization
   - Curated library of proven prompts (categorized by genre, mood, use case)
   - Prompt optimization tool (input basic idea → get optimized prompt)
   - Community features (share, rate, remix prompts)
   - Educational content (how to write great Suno prompts)
   - Mobile-responsive, fast-loading, beautiful UI

3. **User Value:**
   - Users create better songs faster
   - Clear before/after examples showing prompt quality impact
   - Free tier with value, premium tier with advanced features
   - Export/share functionality

4. **Technical Excellence:**
   - Single-page architecture (like other landings in this repo)
   - Fast load times (<2s)
   - SEO-optimized (meta tags, structured data, semantic HTML)
   - Analytics integration
   - Conversion tracking

## UNCERTAINTIES & QUESTIONS

**What I'm Unsure About:**
1. **"Cell-Optimized" Definition:**
   - Does this mean mobile-optimized prompts?
   - Or prompts optimized for Suno's "cell" generation process?
   - Or something else entirely? Need research and definition.

2. **Keyword Strategy:**
   - What are the actual search volumes?
   - What long-tail keywords have low competition?
   - What content gaps exist in current results?

3. **Monetization Model:**
   - Free prompts + premium library?
   - Freemium with usage limits?
   - Affiliate with Suno?
   - Need to validate what users will pay for.

4. **Content Strategy:**
   - How much content is needed to rank?
   - Blog posts vs. tool vs. library?
   - What content format converts best?

5. **Technical Architecture:**
   - Static site vs. dynamic?
   - Database for prompt library?
   - API integration with Suno (if available)?

## MULTI-PERSPECTIVE ANALYSIS NEEDED

**Architect Mind - Technical Implementation:**
- What's the minimal beautiful architecture?
- How should prompts be stored and retrieved?
- What's the optimal file structure?
- How do we ensure fast load times?
- What tech stack aligns with existing repo patterns?

**Oracle Mind - Strategic Positioning:**
- What's the unique angle that competitors miss?

**Critic Mind - Risk & Validation:**
- What could go wrong with this approach?
- What assumptions am I making that might be wrong?
- How do we validate demand before building everything?

   - Landing page copy
   - Meta descriptions and titles
   - Structured data schema

5. **Implementation Plan:**

- Must be maintainable and extensible

## META-REQUESTS

**Pattern Recognition:**
- What patterns from successful SEO platforms apply here?
- What patterns from existing landings in this repo should I reuse?

- What connections or opportunities am I missing?
- What would make this 10x better?
- What's the non-obvious advantage we should leverage?

## THE ASK

Think through this comprehensively. Start with research and strategy, then architecture, then implementation. Don't just build—help me understand the full picture, validate assumptions, and create something that will genuinely dominate search results.

Show me:
1. Research findings (keywords, competition, opportunities)
2. Strategic positioning and unique angle
3. Technical architecture proposal
4. Content and SEO strategy
5. Implementation roadmap
6. Then build the actual platform

I want to understand the "why" behind every decision before we build. This needs to be a masterpiece, not just another prompt generator.

What am I missing? What should I be thinking about that I'm not? What would make this remarkable?
