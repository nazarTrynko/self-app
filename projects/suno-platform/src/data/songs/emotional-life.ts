Coding at 3AM, screen glowing bright
Late night coding, feels so right

[Verse 1]
Programmer life, coffee getting cold
Developer burnout, story untold
One more bug to fix, then I'll sleep
Coding at 3AM, in too deep

[Chorus]
Late night coding, chasing the zone
Programmer life, all alone
Developer burnout creeping in
Coding at 3AM, where to begin

[Verse 2]
Stack overflow is my best friend
Late night coding, doesn't end
Programmer life, we understand
Developer burnout, lend a hand`
