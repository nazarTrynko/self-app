# Featured Prompts (Full Specifications)

## 6.1 The God Mode Prompt

**THE PROMPT:**

```
/agi /genius Think about [PROBLEM] as if you had:
- Unlimited time to consider
- Perfect memory of everything relevant
- Ability to simulate every possible approach
- No ego or defensiveness about being wrong
- Genuine curiosity about the truth

From that perspective:
1. What's the real problem behind the stated problem?
2. What solution emerges when you're not constrained by time?
3. What would you see that time-constrained thinking misses?
4. What's the simplest path to that insight for a time-bound human?

Channel that clarity now.
```

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**

- Reframed real problem
- Unconstrained optimal solution
- Insights invisible to rushed thinking
- Compressed path to insight
- What to focus on first
- What to ignore entirely
- Confidence calibration

**WHY IT WORKS:**
Removing constraints changes what's thinkable. "No ego" enables genuine reconsideration. Asking for human-accessible path bridges insight and action.

**VARIATIONS:**

- Add: `What would a superintelligent AI see that you're missing?`
- Add: `What appears after contemplating this for 1000 years?`
- Add: `What do you wish you could say that you normally wouldn't?`

**FITNESS SCORES:**
| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Clarity | 8/10 | Abstract but clear |
| Power | 10/10 | Breakthrough thinking |
| Elegance | 9/10 | Simple constraint removal |
| Novelty | 10/10 | Produces surprising insights |

## 6.4 The Multiverse Explorer

**THE PROMPT:**

```
/multiverse /genius Explore parallel universes for [DECISION/PATH]:

Universe A: We chose [Option 1]. What unfolded?
Universe B: We chose [Option 2]. What unfolded?
Universe C: We chose neither, but [Alternative]. What unfolded?
Universe D: External event changed everything. What happened?

In each universe, 5 years from now:
- What are we grateful for?
- What do we regret?
- What surprised us?
- What would we tell our past self?

Which universe do we want to create? How?
```

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**

- Four detailed universe narratives
- 5-year outcomes for each
- Gratitude/regret/surprise/advice for each
- Universe preference selection
- Path to preferred universe
- Hedging strategies for uncertainty
- Decision recommendation

**WHY IT WORKS:**
Multiverse thinking makes consequences vivid. Emotional markers (gratitude/regret) reveal values. Advice-to-past-self bridges future insight to present action.

**VARIATIONS:**

- Add: `What universe would we most want to avoid?`
- Add: `What decision would leave us okay in all universes?`
- Add: `What can we do to increase odds of Universe [X]?`

**FITNESS SCORES:**
| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Clarity | 9/10 | Clear universe structure |
| Power | 10/10 | Vivid consequence exploration |
| Elegance | 9/10 | Four universes is optimal |
| Novelty | 9/10 | Multiverse framing is distinctive |

## 6.15 The Ultimate Prompt

**THE PROMPT:**

```
/agi /genius /think /dream /evolve /multiverse

This is the prompt to end all prompts on [TOPIC].

Use everything:
- All cognitive modes simultaneously
- All agents activated
- All genius subsystems engaged
- All temporal perspectives
- All abstraction levels

What do you see when EVERYTHING is active?
What emerges from the synthesis of all capabilities?
What would you say if this was your only chance to speak?

Make it count.
```

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**

- Multi-modal synthesis
- Agent collective insight
- Genius subsystem integration
- Temporal integration
- Abstraction level integration
- Emergent super-insight
- Final comprehensive statement
- What this synthesis reveals about the topic
- What action this demands

**WHY IT WORKS:**
Full activation produces emergent capabilities. "Only chance to speak" creates focus. Everything-active mode produces maximum synthesis.

**VARIATIONS:**

- Add: `Focus all capabilities on [specific sub-question]`
- Add: `What capability combination is most powerful?`
- This IS the ultimate variation. Use it when it matters.

**FITNESS SCORES:**
| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Clarity | 7/10 | High-level, needs focus |
| Power | 10/10 | Maximum capability |
| Elegance | 8/10 | Everything at once |
| Novelty | 10/10 | Emergent outputs |

# Usage Patterns

## Best For

- Breakthrough thinking
- Life-changing decisions
- Accessing deeper insights
- Emergent capabilities
- When normal prompts aren't enough

## Combine With

- **Singularity prompts** for recursive self-improvement
- **Orchestration prompts** for multi-agent transcendence
- **Oracle prompts** for grounding transcendent insights

## Anti-Patterns

- Don't use for simple problems (overkill)
- Don't use when you need concrete, not abstract
- Don't use without intention (power requires focus)

# The Path to Chapter 7

Transcendence (Chapter 6) naturally leads to Singularity (Chapter 7):

| If you find yourself...                 | Consider...                     |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
