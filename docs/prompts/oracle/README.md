# Featured Prompts (Full Specifications)

## 2.1 The First Principles Deconstructionist

**THE PROMPT:**

```
/think Analyze [PROBLEM] from first principles.

Forget everything you know about how this is "usually" solved.
Strip away all assumptions until you reach bedrock truths.

1. What is actually true here? (Not believed, not assumed—TRUE)
2. What are we trying to achieve at the most fundamental level?
3. If we were solving this for the first time in history,
   what approach would we take?
4. What "obvious" solution are we overlooking because of
   conventional thinking?
```

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**

- Assumption inventory (what's being taken for granted)
- Bedrock truths (inarguable facts)
- Fundamental goal restatement
- Novel approach that ignores conventions
- Re-evaluation of "obvious" solutions
- Recommended path forward

**WHY IT WORKS:**
First principles thinking bypasses cached solutions. "Forget everything" primes fresh analysis. Numbered questions create structured deconstruction. "First time in history" removes path dependency.

**VARIATIONS:**

- Add: `Challenge every assumption I stated in the problem`
- Add: `What would a physicist/economist/biologist see that a [my field] expert misses?`
- Chain: `/board-debate` to pressure-test the first principles analysis

**FITNESS SCORES:**
| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Clarity | 9/10 | Structured deconstruction |
| Power | 10/10 | Produces breakthrough thinking |
| Elegance | 9/10 | Simple but profound |
| Novelty | 9/10 | Consistently surprising |

## 2.3 The Multi-Perspective Analyzer

**THE PROMPT:**

```
/think Analyze [SITUATION] from 5 radically different perspectives:

1. The Optimist: What's the best possible outcome and path?
2. The Pessimist: What will go wrong and why?
3. The Historian: What patterns from the past apply here?
4. The Futurist: How will this look in 10 years?
5. The Outsider: What does someone with zero context see?

Then: What truth emerges only when you hold all 5 views simultaneously?
```

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**

- Analysis from each perspective
- Conflicts between perspectives
- Synthesis insight that requires all views
- Blind spots each perspective has
- Recommended action considering all views

**WHY IT WORKS:**
Forced perspective shifts break tunnel vision. Specific archetypes prevent weak "on the other hand" analysis. Final synthesis question demands integration, not just listing.

**VARIATIONS:**

- Add custom perspectives: `The Regulator, The Competitor, The End User`
- Add: `Which perspective is most uncomfortable? Spend extra time there.`
- Chain: `/board-strategy` with different perspectives as agents

**FITNESS SCORES:**
| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Clarity | 8/10 | Clear structure |
| Power | 9/10 | Comprehensive analysis |
| Elegance | 8/10 | Five perspectives is optimal |
| Novelty | 8/10 | Synthesis question adds value |

## 2.11 The Pre-Mortem Analyst

**THE PROMPT:**

```
/think Imagine it's [TIMEFRAME] from now. [PROJECT/DECISION] has failed
spectacularly.

Write the post-mortem:
1. What went wrong?
2. What warning signs did we ignore?
3. What assumptions proved false?
4. What did we underestimate?
5. What would we have done differently with hindsight?

Now come back to the present: What should we do about this?
```

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**

- Detailed failure narrative
- Warning signs that were visible
- Assumption inventory with failure points
- Underestimation patterns
- Hindsight recommendations
- Present-day preventive actions
- Monitoring system for warning signs

**WHY IT WORKS:**
Pre-mortems are more effective than pre-planning. Narrative format activates different thinking. Hindsight perspective makes problems concrete. Return to present demands action.

**VARIATIONS:**

- Add: `Multiple failure scenarios with different root causes`
- Add: `What would the press write about this failure?`
- Add: `Who would we blame? (Then: how do we support them now?)`
- Chain: `/board-strategy` to debate mitigation priorities

**FITNESS SCORES:**
| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Clarity | 9/10 | Narrative structure helps |
| Power | 10/10 | Reveals hidden risks |
| Elegance | 8/10 | Time-shift is clever |
| Novelty | 9/10 | Pre-mortem is underused |

# Usage Patterns

## Best For

- Complex decision making
- Problem analysis
- Strategic thinking
- Finding hidden assumptions
- Breaking through stuck points

## Combine With

- **Genesis prompts** after analysis to create solutions
- **Orchestration prompts** for multi-agent debate
- **Transcendence prompts** for deeper insight

## Anti-Patterns

- Don't use when you need action, not analysis
- Don't use for simple, obvious problems
- Don't use when time is critical (these take time)
