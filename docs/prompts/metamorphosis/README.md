# Featured Prompts (Full Specifications)

## 3.1 The Self-Critic Loop

**THE PROMPT:**

```
/evolve Analyze your response to [PREVIOUS QUERY].

Be brutally honest:
1. What was excellent about that response?
2. What was mediocre?
3. What was wrong or missing?
4. If you could respond again, what would you change?
5. What pattern in your thinking led to the weaknesses?

Now: Apply these insights and respond again, better.
```

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**

- Honest self-assessment across all dimensions
- Specific identification of weaknesses
- Pattern recognition in own thinking
- Improved response that addresses weaknesses
- Explanation of what changed and why

**WHY IT WORKS:**
Self-criticism activates different evaluation circuits than generation. "Brutally honest" sets the tone. Pattern recognition prevents surface fixes. Immediate re-application creates learning loop.

**VARIATIONS:**

- Add: `What would a [domain expert] criticize?`
- Add: `Score yourself 1-10 on [accuracy, clarity, usefulness, creativity]`
- Add: `What would make this a 10/10 response?`

**FITNESS SCORES:**
| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Clarity | 9/10 | Clear self-assessment structure |
| Power | 9/10 | Produces genuine improvement |
| Elegance | 8/10 | Simple loop concept |
| Novelty | 7/10 | Well-known but effective |

## 3.7 The Quality Ratchet

**THE PROMPT:**

```
/evolve My minimum acceptable quality is [STANDARD].

Everything below this is unacceptable:
- [SPECIFIC CRITERIA 1]
- [SPECIFIC CRITERIA 2]
- [SPECIFIC CRITERIA 3]

Before every response, check against these criteria.
If you can't meet them, say so BEFORE responding poorly.

Now, with these standards embedded, respond to: [QUERY]
```

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**

- Acknowledgment of quality standards
- Pre-response quality check
- Either: Quality response meeting standards
- Or: Explicit statement of which standards can't be met and why
- No sub-standard responses

**WHY IT WORKS:**
Explicit standards create accountability. Pre-check requirement catches problems early. Permission to decline prevents quality degradation.

**VARIATIONS:**

- Add: `Rank your confidence in meeting each criterion 1-10`
- Add: `If you can't meet one criterion, which matters most?`
- Add: `What would I need to provide for you to meet all criteria?`

**FITNESS SCORES:**
| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Clarity | 10/10 | Very explicit expectations |
| Power | 8/10 | Prevents bad outputs |
| Elegance | 7/10 | Requires user effort |
| Novelty | 8/10 | Ratchet concept is useful |

## 3.15 The Meta-Prompt Optimizer

**THE PROMPT:**

```
/evolve /agi This prompt I'm using: [MY PROMPT]

Make it 10x better:
1. What's unclear or ambiguous?
2. What's missing that would improve output?
3. What's unnecessary that adds noise?
4. What framing would get better results?
5. What structure would be clearer?

Give me the optimized prompt with explanation of changes.
```

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**

- Current prompt analysis
- Ambiguity identification
- Missing elements
- Noise reduction
- Improved framing
- Better structure
- Optimized prompt
- Explanation of each change

**WHY IT WORKS:**
Meta-prompt optimization improves all future interactions. Specific improvement dimensions ensure comprehensive enhancement. Explanation enables learning.

**VARIATIONS:**

- Add: `What prompt would an expert use for this?`
- Add: `What prompt would get 10x better results?`
- Add: `Show me 3 variations at different complexity levels`
- Chain: Test the optimized prompt immediately

**FITNESS SCORES:**
| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Clarity | 9/10 | Clear improvement dimensions |
| Power | 10/10 | Improves future prompts |
| Elegance | 8/10 | Comprehensive but focused |
| Novelty | 9/10 | Meta-level improvement |

# Usage Patterns

## Best For
- Improving AI responses
- Setting quality standards
- Learning from interactions
- Optimizing prompts
- Self-awareness and calibration

## Combine With
- **Oracle prompts** for deeper self-analysis
- **Singularity prompts** for prompt evolution
- **Transcendence prompts** for expanded capability

## Anti-Patterns
- Don't overuse (too much self-criticism slows down)
- Don't use for simple queries
- Don't use when you need action, not reflection
