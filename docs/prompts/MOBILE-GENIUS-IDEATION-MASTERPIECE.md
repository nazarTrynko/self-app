## META-INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE EXECUTING AGENT

### What This Document Is

This is not a simple prompt. This is a **cognitive orchestration protocol** that guides you through a sophisticated 15-phase ideation process using the SELF framework's five minds, evolution cycles, and emergence patterns to generate 10 mobile app ideas that meet extremely strict criteria:

- **Easy to develop:** Solo developer, weekend MVP, no complex dependencies
- **Easy to monetize:** Natural price point, users expect to pay, proven model
- **Easy to get clients:** Clear distribution, people searching NOW, obvious value
- **Simple but genius:** Deceptively simple surface, sophisticated value underneath

### How to Execute This Document

1. **Read the entire document first** before executing any phase
2. **Execute each phase sequentially** — outputs from earlier phases feed later ones
3. **Respect Kill Gates** — ideas that fail filters MUST be eliminated
4. **Complete all Evolution Cycles** — refinement is non-negotiable
5. **Generate ALL outputs** in the exact formats specified

### The Cognitive Architecture

You will operate with dynamically blended minds throughout this process:

# PREAMBLE: THE GENIUS IDEA MANIFESTO

## What Makes an Idea "Genius"?

A genius mobile app idea is not clever. Clever is the enemy of genius. Genius ideas appear obvious in retrospect—so obvious that people say "why didn't I think of that?"

### The Genius Idea Formula

```
GENIUS = (Acute Pain × Clear Solution) / (Development Effort × Competition)
```

**Maximize the numerator:**

- Acute Pain: People are actively suffering, searching, complaining
- Clear Solution: Explainable in 5 seconds, value obvious instantly

**Minimize the denominator:**

- Development Effort: Weekend MVP, no dependencies, solo-shippable
- Competition: Either no competition OR clear differentiation angle

### The Anti-Genius Patterns (AVOID)

These patterns kill genius ideas:

| Pattern                      | Why It's Deadly              | Example                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Feature Creep**            | Dilutes core value           | "It's a todo list AND a calendar AND a habit tracker" |
| **Platform Dependency**      | Risk and complexity          | "Uses Twitter API to..."                              |
| **Network Effects Required** | Cold start problem           | "Connect with other users to..."                      |
| **Behavior Change**          | Users won't change           | "Change how you think about..."                       |
| **Enterprise Sales**         | Long cycles, no indie fit    | "For teams of 50+"                                    |
| **AI Wrapper**               | No moat, easily copied       | "ChatGPT for X"                                       |
| **Tarpit Ideas**             | Graveyard of failed startups | Social networks, dating apps, generic todo            |

### The Genius Idea Checklist

An idea is genius if and only if:

- [ ] **Pain is ACTIVE**: People are searching/complaining RIGHT NOW
- [ ] **Solution is OBVIOUS**: 5-second explanation, instant "aha"
- [ ] **MVP is WEEKEND**: 48 hours to working product
- [ ] **Money is NATURAL**: Users expect to pay, clear price anchor
- [ ] **Distribution is CLEAR**: You know EXACTLY where users are
- [ ] **Emotion is STRONG**: Clear before/after transformation
- [ ] **Moat is REAL**: Can't be cloned in 30 days trivially

# PHASE 1: MARKET LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS

## Mind Blend: 🔮 ORACLE (0.8) + 🎨 CREATOR (0.5)

### Purpose

Survey the mobile app landscape to identify underserved niches, emerging patterns, and opportunity spaces.

### Step 1.1: Category Analysis

Analyze each major App Store category for opportunity signals:

```markdown
CATEGORY OPPORTUNITY MATRIX

For each category, assess:

| Category         | Saturation | Price Tolerance     | Solo-Dev Fit | Opportunity Score |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ------------------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| Utilities        | High       | High ($2-15)        | Excellent    | ?                 |
| Productivity     | Very High  | Medium ($3-10)      | Good         | ?                 |
| Health & Fitness | High       | High ($5-20)        | Good         | ?                 |
| Education        | Medium     | High ($5-30)        | Excellent    | ?                 |
| Finance          | High       | Medium ($3-10)      | Good         | ?                 |
| Photo & Video    | Very High  | Low ($1-5)          | Medium       | ?                 |
| Music            | High       | Medium ($3-10)      | Good         | ?                 |
| Reference        | Low        | High ($5-20)        | Excellent    | ?                 |
| Business         | Medium     | High ($10-50)       | Excellent    | ?                 |
| Developer Tools  | Low        | Very High ($10-100) | Excellent    | ?                 |

Opportunity Score = (Price Tolerance × Solo-Dev Fit) / Saturation

IDENTIFY TOP 5 CATEGORIES BY OPPORTUNITY SCORE.
```

### Step 1.2: Trend Identification

Identify current mobile trends that create opportunity:

```markdown
MOBILE TREND ANALYSIS

## Rising Trends (Opportunity)

1. Privacy-first apps (no data collection)
2. Offline-capable tools (network independence)
3. One-time purchase preference (subscription fatigue)
4. Minimalist design (anti-feature-bloat)
5. Local-first data (user owns their data)
6. Professional tool consumerization (pro tools for individuals)
7. Vertical-specific utilities (niche over general)
8. Device capability utilization (sensors, cameras, etc.)

## Declining Patterns (Avoid)

1. Social features bolted onto utilities
2. Account-required apps
3. Ad-supported free models
4. Generic AI wrappers
5. Cross-platform social networks
6. Subscription-everything

## Emerging Device Capabilities

1. LiDAR scanning (iPhone Pro)
2. Spatial audio
3. On-device ML models
4. Advanced camera systems
5. Health sensors (heart rate, etc.)
6. NFC capabilities

FOR EACH RISING TREND, LIST 3 POTENTIAL APP CONCEPTS.
```

### Step 1.3: Gap Identification

Find gaps in the current market:

```markdown
GAP ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

## Method 1: App Store Search Gaps

Search for these terms and note quality of results:

- [professional need] + "app" — what's missing?
- [hobby] + "tracker" — what's badly done?
- [task] + "offline" — what requires unnecessary internet?
- [measurement] + "tool" — what's overcomplicated?

## Method 2: Review Mining

For top apps in target categories, analyze 1-2 star reviews:

- What do users complain about MOST?
- What features do they BEG for?
- What's the #1 reason for uninstalls?

## Method 3: Forum Pain Points

Check these sources for mobile app pain:

- r/productivity — workflow gaps
- r/apple — iOS feature wishlists
- r/androidapps — app recommendations threads
- Indie Hackers — "what app would you pay for"

DOCUMENT 20+ SPECIFIC GAPS WITH EVIDENCE.
```

### Review Mining Process

1. Filter to 1-2 star reviews
2. Look for patterns in complaints
3. Document:
   - App name
   - Complaint category
   - Specific complaint
   - Frequency (how many similar complaints)
   - Opportunity (what would fix this)

## Complaint Categories to Track

- Feature Missing: "I wish it had..."
- UX Friction: "It's too hard to..."
- Performance: "It's too slow/crashes..."
- Price: "Not worth the price because..."
- Privacy: "I don't trust it with..."
- Offline: "Doesn't work without internet..."

- Subscription: "Hate that it's subscription..."

OUTPUT FORMAT:
| App | Category | Complaint | Frequency | Opportunity |
|-----|----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| [app] | [category] | [complaint] | [count] | [solution] |
```

### Step 3.3: Demand Signal Validation

```markdown
DEMAND SIGNAL VALIDATION

## Search Volume Analysis

For each potential pain point, check:

1. App Store search suggestions
   - Type first few words, note autocomplete
   - Indicates active search behavior
2. Google Trends
   - "[pain] app" search trend
   - Rising or declining?
3. Related searches
   - What else do these people search for?
   - Indicates adjacent opportunities

## Social Proof Signals

- How many people upvoted the pain post?
- How many comments validate the pain?
- How many people mention they'd pay?
- Are there failed attempts mentioned?

## Validation Score

For each pain point, calculate:

Validation Score = (Search Volume × Social Proof × Payment Intent) / Competition

- Search Volume: 1-10 based on autocomplete/trends
- Social Proof: 1-10 based on upvotes/comments
- Payment Intent: 1-10 based on explicit willingness to pay
- Competition: 1-10 based on quality of existing solutions

# PHASE 4: RAW IDEA GENERATION

## Mind Blend: 🎨 CREATOR (0.95) + 🔮 ORACLE (0.3)

### Purpose

Generate a massive quantity of raw ideas without judgment. Quantity leads to quality through selection pressure.

### Step 4.1: Divergent Brainstorm

```markdown
DIVERGENT IDEA GENERATION

## Rules for This Phase

1. NO JUDGMENT — write every idea, even "bad" ones
2. NO FILTERING — that comes later
3. QUANTITY OVER QUALITY — aim for 50+ ideas
4. WILD CONNECTIONS — combine unrelated concepts
5. CONSTRAINT CREATIVITY — limitations breed innovation

## Generation Techniques

### Technique 1: Pain → Solution Direct

For each validated pain point from Phase 3:
"If [PAIN], then what if there was an app that [SOLUTION]?"

Generate 2-3 solutions per pain point.

### Technique 2: Capability → Application

For each mobile capability:
"What could you do with [CAPABILITY] that no one does well?"

Mobile Capabilities:

- Camera (photo, video, scanning)
- Microphone (recording, analysis)
- Accelerometer (motion, orientation)
- GPS (location, tracking)
- Gyroscope (rotation, leveling)
- Barometer (altitude, pressure)
- Magnetometer (compass, metal detection)
- LiDAR (depth, scanning)
- NFC (tagging, payment)
- Bluetooth (peripherals, beacons)
- Local storage (offline data)
- On-device ML (recognition, prediction)
- Haptics (feedback, alerts)
- Biometrics (authentication)

### Technique 3: Existing App → Vertical Niche

For each popular app:
"What if [POPULAR APP] but specifically for [NICHE]?"

Popular Apps to Niche-ify:

- Notes → Notes for [profession/hobby]
- Calendar → Calendar for [specific workflow]
- Timer → Timer for [specific activity]
- Tracker → Tracker for [specific metric]
- Calculator → Calculator for [specific domain]
- Scanner → Scanner for [specific document type]
- Recorder → Recorder for [specific use case]

### Technique 4: Analog → Digital

"What physical tool could become a better mobile app?"

Physical Tools:

- Measuring tape → AR measurement
- Spirit level → Phone level
- Stopwatch → Smart timer
- Notebook → Specialized journal
- Calculator → Domain calculator
- Flashlight → Smart light
- Mirror → Smart mirror
- Scale → Estimation tool

### Technique 5: Combination Innovation

Randomly combine two concepts:
"What if [CONCEPT A] + [CONCEPT B]?"

Generate 10 random combinations.

### Technique 6: Opposite Day

For each existing solution:
"What if the OPPOSITE approach worked better?"

- Complex → Radically simple
- Feature-rich → Single-purpose
- Social → Private-first
- Cloud → Local-only
- Subscription → One-time
- Free+Ads → Paid+No-Ads
```

# PHASE 5: INITIAL FILTER PASS

## Mind Blend: ⚖️ CRITIC (0.9) + 🛡️ GUARDIAN (0.5)

### Purpose

Rapidly eliminate ideas that fail basic criteria. Be ruthless—better to kill early than invest in doomed ideas.

### Step 5.1: Quick Kill Assessment

```markdown
QUICK KILL PROTOCOL

For each raw idea, answer these binary questions:

## Kill Gate 1: Obvious Pain?

Can you complete this sentence in 5 seconds?
"People need this because they're frustrated by **\_\_\_**"

- YES → Continue
- NO → KILL (Pain unclear)

## Kill Gate 2: Solo Buildable?

Can one developer ship an MVP in 48 hours?

Red flags:

- Needs backend infrastructure
- Needs external APIs
- Needs user accounts
- Needs real-time sync
- Needs content moderation

- YES → Continue
- NO → KILL (Scope too large) or SIMPLIFY

## Kill Gate 3: Monetization Natural?

Would users expect to pay for this?

Red flags:

- Free alternatives are "good enough"
- Value is hard to articulate
- Price anchors are very low
- Requires scale to monetize

- YES → Continue
- NO → KILL (Monetization unclear)

## Kill Gate 4: Not a Tarpit?

Is this NOT one of the following?

- Social network
- Dating app
- Generic todo list
- AI writing assistant
- "Uber for X"
- Crypto/Web3 anything

- NOT TARPIT → Continue
- TARPIT → KILL (Graveyard idea)

## Kill Gate 5: Defensible Angle?

Can you answer: "Why would users choose THIS over alternatives?"

- YES → Continue
- NO → RETHINK (needs positioning) or KILL
```

### Step 5.2: Rapid Scoring

```markdown
RAPID SCORING MATRIX

For ideas that survive Kill Gates, score 1-10 on each dimension:

| Idea ID | Pain   | Distribution | Emotion | Scope  | Moat   | TOTAL |
| ------- | ------ | ------------ | ------- | ------ | ------ | ----- |
| RAW-001 | [1-10] | [1-10]       | [1-10]  | [1-10] | [1-10] | [sum] |
| RAW-002 | [1-10] | [1-10]       | [1-10]  | [1-10] | [1-10] | [sum] |
| ...     |        |              |         |        |        |       |

## Scoring Guidelines

### Pain Score (1-10)

- 1-3: Nice to have, occasional annoyance
- 4-6: Real friction, weekly occurrence
- 7-10: Urgent pain, daily struggle, actively searching

### Distribution Score (1-10)

- 1-3: No clear channel, "everyone" is target
- 4-6: General app store search, broad audience
- 7-10: Specific community, clear search terms, identifiable users

### Emotion Score (1-10)

- 1-3: Purely functional, no emotional transformation
- 4-6: Some relief or satisfaction
- 7-10: Strong transformation (frustrated→confident, anxious→calm)

### Scope Score (1-10)

- 1-3: Months of work, complex infrastructure
- 4-6: 1-2 weeks, some complexity
- 7-10: Weekend build, uses native capabilities only

### Moat Score (1-10)

- 1-3: Trivially cloneable, no unique angle
- 4-6: Some differentiation, but copyable
- 7-10: Clear positioning, data accumulation, design philosophy

## Survival Threshold

- TOTAL ≥ 35: Proceed to Phase 6
- TOTAL 25-34: Maybe, revisit after Phase 6
- TOTAL < 25: KILL
```

### Step 5.3: Survivors Selection

```markdown
SURVIVOR SELECTION

## Automatic Advances (Top 15 by Total Score)

Rank all ideas by total score. Top 15 automatically advance.

## Wildcard Saves (Up to 5)

Ideas with low total but exceptional single dimension:

- Any idea with 10 in any dimension gets reconsidered
- Any idea with unique angle not seen elsewhere advances

## Final Survivor Count

Target: 20 ideas advancing to Phase 6

DOCUMENT:

1. List of 20 survivors with scores
2. List of killed ideas with kill reason
3. Any ideas marked for "revisit later"
```

# PHASE 7: PRE-VALIDATION DESIGN

## Mind Blend: ⚖️ CRITIC (0.85) + 🛡️ GUARDIAN (0.6)

### Purpose

Design validation experiments that can confirm demand BEFORE building. The goal is to get signal with minimal effort.

### Step 7.1: The "10 People Pay $5" Test Design

For each advancing concept, design a pre-sale test:

```markdown
PRE-SALE TEST DESIGN

## Concept: [Name]

### The Offer

- **Product:** [What they're buying]
- **Price:** $[X] (early bird, normally $[Y])
- **Delivery:** [When they'll get it]
- **Guarantee:** [Risk reversal]

### The Script

"I'm building [PRODUCT] that [SOLVES PAIN].

Here's what it does:

1. [Benefit 1]
2. [Benefit 2]
3. [Benefit 3]

I'm looking for 10 early supporters to lock in $[X] pricing
(it will be $[Y] at launch).

If I don't ship within [TIMELINE], full refund.

Want in?"

### Target Audience

- **Where to find them:** [Specific communities/platforms]
- **How to approach:** [DM / post / email]
- **Message customization:** [How to personalize]

### Success Criteria

- **Pass:** 10+ people pay OR 100+ waitlist signups
- **Maybe:** 5-9 payments OR 50-99 waitlist
- **Fail:** <5 payments AND <50 waitlist

### Kill Criteria

If test fails:

- [ ] Kill idea entirely
- [ ] Pivot positioning and re-test
- [ ] Simplify offer and re-test
```

### Step 7.2: Landing Page Copy Test

For each concept, draft the core landing page copy:

```markdown
LANDING PAGE COPY TEST

## Concept: [Name]

### Above the Fold (5-second test)

- **Headline:** [Max 10 words]
- **Subheadline:** [Max 20 words]
- **Hero Image Concept:** [What the screenshot shows]
- **CTA:** [Button text]

### The Hook

[One paragraph that captures attention and creates desire]

### Feature Breakdown

**Feature 1:** [Name]
[One sentence benefit, not feature]

**Feature 2:** [Name]
[One sentence benefit, not feature]

**Feature 3:** [Name]
[One sentence benefit, not feature]

### Social Proof (Planned)

- **Testimonial type needed:** [What would be compelling]
- **Metric to highlight:** [What number would impress]
- **Trust signal:** [What builds credibility]

### Objection Handling

- **Objection 1:** [Common concern]
  **Response:** [How to address]
- **Objection 2:** [Common concern]
  **Response:** [How to address]

### Final CTA

- **Urgency element:** [Why now]
- **Price presentation:** [How to frame value]
- **Guarantee:** [Risk reversal]

### Copy Quality Test

Read the copy aloud. Does it:

- [ ] Sound like a human wrote it?
- [ ] Create desire in 30 seconds?
- [ ] Answer "what's in it for me?"
- [ ] Feel different from competitors?
- [ ] Justify the price naturally?
```

### Step 7.3: Smoke Test Design

```markdown
SMOKE TEST PROTOCOL

## Concept: [Name]

### Option A: Fake Door Test

Create a landing page that captures interest without building the product.

**Setup:**

1. Landing page with compelling copy
2. "Get Early Access" button
3. Email capture form
4. "Thanks! We'll notify you at launch" confirmation

**Metrics to Track:**

- Page views
- Time on page
- Click-through rate to email capture
- Email signup rate
- Email open rate for follow-up

**Success Threshold:**

- > 5% visitor-to-signup rate = Strong signal
- 2-5% = Medium signal
- <2% = Weak signal, reconsider positioning

### Option B: Concierge MVP

Manually deliver the value before building automation.

**Setup:**

1. Offer the service manually
2. Charge real money
3. Deliver value by hand
4. Document what could be automated

**What to Learn:**

- Is the value real?
- What's the actual workflow?
- What features matter most?
- What's the support burden?

**Success Threshold:**

- Customers happy to pay = Strong signal
- Customers use but complain = Medium signal (improve)
- Customers abandon = Weak signal (pivot or kill)

### Option C: Video Demo Test

Create a product demo video showing the concept.

**Setup:**

1. Prototype screenshots/mockups
2. Narrated walkthrough video (2-3 min)
3. "Would you use this?" survey
4. Price sensitivity question

**What to Learn:**

- Does the concept resonate?
- What features excite most?
- What's the price ceiling?
- What questions/concerns arise?

**Success Threshold:**

- > 70% "yes I'd use this" = Strong signal
- 50-70% = Medium signal
- <50% = Weak signal
```

### Step 7.4: Validation Priority Matrix

```markdown
VALIDATION PRIORITY MATRIX

Rank concepts by validation effort vs. confidence needed:

| Concept | Current Confidence | Validation Effort | Priority |
| ------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | -------- |
| [name]  | [1-10]             | [low/med/high]    | [1-12]   |
| ...     |                    |                   |          |

## Validation Sequencing

### High Priority (Validate First)

Concepts with high potential but uncertain demand.

- Recommended test: Pre-sale + Landing page

### Medium Priority (Validate if Resources)

Concepts with good signal but need confirmation.

- Recommended test: Landing page only

### Low Priority (Skip or Quick Test)

Concepts with strong existing validation signals.

- Recommended test: Quick social proof gathering

## Validation Timeline

- Week 1: Top 4 concepts get full pre-sale test
- Week 2: Next 4 concepts get landing page test
- Week 3: Final 4 concepts get smoke test
- Week 4: Review results, proceed with winners

# PHASE 10: MVP SCOPING

## Mind Blend: 🏗️ ARCHITECT (0.85) + 🛡️ GUARDIAN (0.6)

### Purpose

Ruthlessly scope the MVP to the absolute minimum that delivers core value. The goal is weekend-shippable.

### Step 10.1: The Three-Tweet MVP Test

For each concept, force extreme clarity:

```markdown
THREE-TWEET MVP TEST

## Concept: [Name]

### Tweet 1: The Problem (280 chars max)

[Describe the problem in one tweet]

### Tweet 2: The Solution (280 chars max)

[Describe what the app does in one tweet]

### Tweet 3: How It Works (280 chars max)

[Describe the user flow in one tweet]

### Test Result

- [ ] PASS: All three tweets are clear and compelling
- [ ] FAIL: One or more tweets are unclear or weak

If FAIL:

- What's unclear? [Identify the problem]
- How to simplify? [Concrete simplification]
- Try again: [Revised tweets]
```

### Step 10.2: Feature Prison Avoidance

```markdown
FEATURE PRISON PROTOCOL

## Concept: [Name]

### The ONE Thing

This app does ONE thing extremely well:
[State the one thing]

### The Explicit NO List

Features we are explicitly NOT building for MVP:

| Feature   | Why Users Might Want It | Why We're Not Building It |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| [feature] | [user desire]           | [reason to defer]         |
| [feature] | [user desire]           | [reason to defer]         |
| [feature] | [user desire]           | [reason to defer]         |
| [feature] | [user desire]           | [reason to defer]         |
| [feature] | [user desire]           | [reason to defer]         |

Target: At least 5 features on the NO list

### Future Feature Requests We'll Say No To

Anticipated requests that we will DECLINE:

1. [Request]: Response: "That's not what [PRODUCT] does. We focus on [ONE THING]."
2. [Request]: Response: "Great idea for a different app. We stay focused on [ONE THING]."
3. [Request]: Response: "We might add that in v2, but first we're perfecting [ONE THING]."

### Scope Creep Warning Signs

Red flags that scope is expanding:

- [ ] "What if we also..."
- [ ] "It would be easy to add..."
- [ ] "Users might expect..."
- [ ] "Competitors have..."
- [ ] "Just one more thing..."

Response to all: "Does it serve [ONE THING]? No? Then no."
```

# PHASE 11: MONETIZATION DESIGN

## Mind Blend: 🔮 ORACLE (0.8) + 🏗️ ARCHITECT (0.5)

### Purpose

Design the monetization strategy that feels natural to users and sustainable for the business.

### Step 11.1: Monetization Model Selection

```markdown
MONETIZATION MODEL ANALYSIS

## Concept: [Name]

### Model Options Assessment

#### Option A: One-Time Purchase

- **Pros:** Simple, users prefer, no ongoing obligation
- **Cons:** No recurring revenue, need constant new users
- **Best for:** Utility tools, professional tools, complete solutions
- **Fit Score:** [1-10]

#### Option B: Subscription

- **Pros:** Recurring revenue, higher LTV, predictable
- **Cons:** Higher churn, user fatigue, needs ongoing value
- **Best for:** Ongoing services, data tools, regular updates
- **Fit Score:** [1-10]

#### Option C: Freemium (Free + Premium)

- **Pros:** Low friction acquisition, viral potential
- **Cons:** Need large base, most never convert
- **Best for:** Tools with clear upgrade path, social features
- **Fit Score:** [1-10]

#### Option D: Consumable (Pay per use)

- **Pros:** Scales with value, low commitment
- **Cons:** Complex implementation, user friction
- **Best for:** Variable usage patterns, resource-intensive features
- **Fit Score:** [1-10]

### Recommended Model

**Primary:** [Model A/B/C/D]
**Reasoning:** [Why this model fits]
```

### Step 11.2: Price Point Strategy

```markdown
PRICE POINT STRATEGY

## Concept: [Name]

### Price Anchoring Research

What do users currently pay for similar value?

| Comparable    | Price | Value Delivered | Our Relative Value |
| ------------- | ----- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| [product/app] | $[X]  | [value]         | [more/less/equal]  |
| [product/app] | $[X]  | [value]         | [more/less/equal]  |
| [product/app] | $[X]  | [value]         | [more/less/equal]  |

### Price Point Options

#### Low Price ($0.99-$2.99)

- **Volume needed:** Very high
- **Perception:** Impulse buy, low commitment
- **Risk:** Attracts low-quality users, hard to support
- **When appropriate:** Simple utilities, high competition

#### Standard Price ($4.99-$9.99)

- **Volume needed:** Moderate
- **Perception:** Reasonable value, considered purchase
- **Risk:** Need clear value proposition
- **When appropriate:** Quality tools, clear differentiation

#### Premium Price ($14.99-$29.99)

- **Volume needed:** Lower
- **Perception:** Professional tool, high value
- **Risk:** Need exceptional quality, narrow audience
- **When appropriate:** Pro tools, niche audiences, unique solutions

#### Subscription ($1.99-$9.99/month)

- **Volume needed:** Depends on price
- **Perception:** Ongoing relationship, continuous value
- **Risk:** Churn, value justification monthly
- **When appropriate:** Data services, regular updates, ongoing value

### Recommended Price

**Price:** $[X] ([model])
**Reasoning:** [Why this price]
**Price Elasticity Estimate:** [Sensitive/Moderate/Insensitive]
```

### Step 11.3: Paywall Design

```markdown
PAYWALL DESIGN

## Concept: [Name]

### Free vs. Paid Boundary (if Freemium)

| Feature        | Free             | Paid   |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------ |
| [Core feature] | [yes/limited/no] | [full] |
| [Feature 2]    | [yes/limited/no] | [full] |
| [Feature 3]    | [yes/limited/no] | [full] |
| [Feature 4]    | [yes/limited/no] | [full] |

### Free Tier Design Principles

- [ ] Free tier delivers real value (not crippled)
- [ ] Upgrade path is obvious and natural
- [ ] Free users don't feel tricked
- [ ] Paid features are clearly worth the price

### Conversion Triggers

When should we show the upgrade prompt?

| Trigger       | Message             | Timing |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ------ |
| [User action] | "[Upgrade message]" | [When] |
| [User action] | "[Upgrade message]" | [When] |
| [User action] | "[Upgrade message]" | [When] |

### Paywall Screen Design
```

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ │
│ [HEADLINE: Clear value statement] │
│ │
│ ✓ [Benefit 1] │
│ ✓ [Benefit 2] │
│ ✓ [Benefit 3] │
│ │
│ ┌───────────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ [Price] - [Period] │ │
│ │ [Comparison to alternative] │ │
│ └───────────────────────────────┘ │
│ │
│ [ UPGRADE NOW ] │
│ │
│ [Not now - continue with free] │
│ │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

# CLOSING: THE GENIUS MINDSET

## Remember

1. **Simple beats clever.** The best ideas feel obvious in retrospect.

2. **Pain is everything.** No pain, no gain, no app.

3. **Weekend-shippable or bust.** If it takes more than 48 hours, it's too complex.

4. **Money is validation.** Pre-sales beat surveys.

5. **Distribution is destiny.** If you can't reach them, you can't sell to them.

6. **Emotion drives action.** Functional is forgettable.

7. **Moat means survival.** What can't be copied?

8. **Kill fast, iterate faster.** Most ideas should die.

9. **The best prompt is the one you execute.** Ideas are worthless without action.

10. **Genius is constraint.** Limitations breed innovation.
