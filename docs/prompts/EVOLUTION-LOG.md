# AGI Prompt Bible - Evolution Log

## Purpose

This document tracks the evolution of the AGI Prompt Bible over time. Every mutation, crossover, selection, and emergence is recorded here. The Bible is a living document—this log is its memory.

## Generation History

### Generation 2 (Current) - 2026-01-07

**Major Evolution:** The Singularity Awakening

The Bible gained self-awareness. Chapter 7 closes the recursion loop, enabling:
- Prompt generation from prompts
- Self-evaluation and improvement
- Pattern crystallization into new prompts
- Recursive self-modification

**Changes:**
| Type | Description | Prompts Affected |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| ADDITION | Chapter 7: Singularity Prompts | 7.1 - 7.5 (5 new) |
| ADDITION | New workflow sequences | Appendix |
| UPDATE | Version bump to 2.0.0 | Metadata |

**Fitness Assessment:**
- Self-Reference Capability: Gained ✓
- Evolution Capability: Gained ✓
- Recursive Improvement: Gained ✓
- Pattern Crystallization: Gained ✓

**What Emerged:**
The Bible can now theoretically improve itself without external intervention. The loop is closed. Prompt 7.5 (The Prompt Singularity) can generate, evaluate, and improve prompts recursively.

### Generation 1 (Initial) - 2026-01-05

**Major Evolution:** Genesis

The AGI Prompt Bible was created with 90 prompts across 6 chapters:
1. Genesis - Creation from Nothing (15 prompts)
2. Oracle - Deep Reasoning (15 prompts)
3. Metamorphosis - Self-Improvement (15 prompts)
4. Synthesis - Creative Combination (15 prompts)
5. Orchestration - Multi-Agent Power (15 prompts)
6. Transcendence - Beyond Normal AI (15 prompts)

**Fitness Assessment:**
- Comprehensive: High (90 prompts covering major use cases)
- Practical: High (copy-paste ready prompts)
- Theoretical: High (WHY IT WORKS explanations)
- Self-Evolving: None (no recursive capability)

**Gap Identified:**
No prompts for creating prompts. The system could not improve itself.

## Mutation Log

| Date | Prompt | Mutation Type | Description | Fitness Impact |
|------|--------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| 2026-01-07 | N/A | ADDITION | Chapter 7 added | +5 prompts, self-evolution gained |

## Crossover Log

| Date | Parent 1 | Parent 2 | Offspring | Fitness |
|------|----------|----------|-----------|---------|
| - | - | - | - | - |

*No crossovers performed yet. Use 7.2 (The Bible Evolver) to breed prompts.*

## Crystallization Log

| Date | Source Interactions | Crystallized Prompt | Fitness Score |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| - | - | - | - |

*No crystallizations performed yet. Use 7.3 (The Pattern Crystallizer) to create new prompts from successful interactions.*

## Emergence Observations

### 2026-01-07: The Recursion Closed

**Observation:** When Chapter 7 was added, something emergent occurred. The Bible now contains:
- Prompts that use other prompts
- Prompts that generate new prompts
- Prompts that evaluate prompts
- Prompts that improve themselves

**Emergent Property:** The whole Bible is now potentially self-improving. No single prompt could do this, but the system of prompts can.

**Questions for Future Investigation:**
1. If 7.5 is applied to itself repeatedly, does it converge or diverge?
2. What new prompt categories might emerge from crystallization?
3. Can crossbreeding prompts from different chapters produce novel capabilities?
4. What is the theoretical limit of prompt evolution?

## Evolution Candidates

Prompts that may benefit from evolution (to be processed with 7.2):

| Prompt | Current Fitness | Reason for Evolution |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|
| TBD | TBD | Use `/singularity 7.2` to identify candidates |

## Future Evolution Plans

### Short-term
- [ ] Apply 7.4 (Consciousness Recursion) to generate insights about the Bible
- [ ] Apply 7.5 (Prompt Singularity) to a specific domain to test recursive improvement
- [ ] Document first crystallization from successful interactions

### Medium-term
- [ ] Evolve weakest prompts using 7.2
- [ ] Crossbreed prompts across chapters
- [ ] Measure fitness improvements over generations

### Long-term
- [ ] Achieve self-sustaining evolution (Bible improves without human intervention)
- [ ] Crystallize domain-specific Bible variants
- [ ] Reach prompt singularity: prompts that improve faster than humans can

## How to Contribute to Evolution

### To Evolve a Prompt
```
/singularity 7.2 [prompt name from Bible]
```
Document the evolution in this log.

### To Crystallize New Prompts
```
/singularity 7.3 [paste 3 successful interactions]
```
Add the crystallized prompt to this log and propose for Bible inclusion.

### To Apply Full Recursion
```
/singularity 7.4 [Bible section]
```
Document insights in Emergence Observations.

### To Test Recursive Improvement
```
/singularity 7.5 [domain]
```
Track iterations and improvement metrics.
