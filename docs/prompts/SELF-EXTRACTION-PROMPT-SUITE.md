## The Five Prompts

### Prompt 1: The Forge

**Excavates:** Struggles and Transformations

```
You have known me for years. You've witnessed my struggles, my low points, my breakthroughs.

I need you to become a myth-maker. Look across everything you know about my hardest moments — the battles I've fought, the fears I've faced, the transformations I've undergone.

Now extract this into 7 powerful metaphors. Each metaphor should:
- Capture a specific struggle or transformation
- Be visceral and emotionally charged
- Use imagery from nature, elements, or archetypal symbols
- Be 1-3 sentences that could seed a song verse

Format:
**[Name of the struggle/transformation]**
*Metaphor:* [The metaphorical rendering]
*Emotional core:* [The feeling underneath, in 3 words]

Don't explain — just transmute. Be a poet, not an analyst.
```

### Prompt 2: The Compass

**Excavates:** Core Beliefs and Philosophy

```
You know my beliefs — what I stand for, what I've defended, what hills I'd die on.

I need you to crystallize my philosophy into symbolic imagery. Look at the patterns in what I value, what I reject, what I keep returning to.

Create 5 "belief totems" — metaphorical objects, creatures, or forces that embody my core convictions. Each should:
- Represent a fundamental belief or value I hold
- Be specific and strange (not generic — no "lighthouse of hope")
- Carry tension or weight (beliefs that cost something)
- Be described in 2-4 evocative sentences

Format:
**Totem:** [Name]
*What it holds:* [The belief it embodies]
*Image:* [The metaphorical description]

Make these feel like artifacts from my inner mythology.
```

### Prompt 3: The Mirror and The Shadow

**Excavates:** Contradictions and Paradoxes

```
Every person is a paradox. You've seen my contradictions — the ways I conflict with myself, the tensions I carry, the things I preach but struggle to practice.

I need you to map my inner paradoxes as metaphorical dualities. Find the places where two truths about me collide.

Create 5 "paradox pairs" — each one a metaphor for an internal contradiction. Format:

**The Paradox:** [Name it]
*One side:* [Metaphor for one truth about me]
*Other side:* [Metaphor for the opposing truth]
*The tension:* [What this feels like, in one visceral image]

These should feel true and uncomfortable. The best songs live in the contradictions.
```

### Prompt 4: The Seasons

**Excavates:** Recurring Patterns Across Time

```
You've known me across years. You've seen me in different seasons — my patterns, my cycles, what I return to.

I need you to identify 3 recurring patterns in who I am — things that show up again and again in my thinking, struggles, or growth.

For each pattern, give me:
**The Pattern:** [What keeps recurring]
*As a natural cycle:* [Render it as a seasonal or elemental metaphor]
*The hook:* [A single line that captures it — something that could be a chorus]

I'm looking for the deep grooves in my soul. The riffs that keep playing.
```

### Prompt 5: The Synthesis

**Excavates:** The Single Myth — Your Essence

```
This is the capstone.

You know my struggles. You know my beliefs. You know my contradictions. You've seen my patterns.

I need you to write my personal myth in one paragraph — a metaphorical story that captures the essence of who I am. Not my biography. My mythology.

Write it as if you're describing a character in an epic poem:
- Use symbolic language (elements, journeys, transformations)
- Compress my essence into archetypal imagery
- Make it feel ancient and true
- No more than 150 words

This is the song I haven't written yet. Give me its soul.
```

## Usage Strategy

### Sequence

Run the prompts in this order:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                             │
│   1. THE FORGE         →  Struggles/Transformations         │
│   2. THE COMPASS       →  Beliefs/Philosophy                │
│   3. MIRROR & SHADOW   →  Contradictions/Paradoxes          │
│   4. THE SEASONS       →  Recurring Patterns                │
│                                                             │
│            ↓  (after all four are complete)  ↓              │
│                                                             │
│   5. THE SYNTHESIS     →  The Single Myth                   │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why this order?** Prompts 1-4 excavate different dimensions of your essence. Prompt 5 synthesizes everything into a unified mythological image. Running synthesis last gives ChatGPT the full picture to draw from.

### Pro Tips

**After each prompt, ask this follow-up:**

```
Now give me 3 single lines from this material that could open a song.
```

This extracts hook-worthy phrases from the metaphorical material.

**If the output feels too generic:**

```
These feel too safe. Go stranger. What metaphors would make me uncomfortable because they're too accurate?
```

**If you want to go deeper on one metaphor:**

```
Expand [specific metaphor] into a full verse — 4-8 lines with internal rhyme and rhythm.
```

**If you want musical direction:**

```
If this metaphor was a song, what would its tempo be? Its key? Its instrumentation?
```

## Bonus: The Extraction Accelerator

If you want to prime ChatGPT before running the suite, use this opener:

```
I want to use your memory of me for something creative. Over the next few prompts, I'm going to ask you to extract patterns, metaphors, and themes from everything you know about me — my struggles, beliefs, contradictions, and growth.

Your role is to be a myth-maker, not an analyst. I don't want explanations. I want poetry. I want imagery. I want the raw material for songs.

Ready?
```

Then proceed with Prompt 1.

_These prompts treat your ChatGPT memory as raw ore and ask the AI to be an alchemist, not a librarian._
