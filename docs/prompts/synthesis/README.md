# Featured Prompts (Full Specifications)

## 4.1 The Cross-Domain Connector

**THE PROMPT:**

```
/xray /think Apply principles from [DOMAIN A] to solve [PROBLEM IN DOMAIN B].

1. What are the core principles that make Domain A work?
2. What are the unsolved problems in Domain B?
3. Which principles from A could transform B?
4. What hybrid solution emerges?
5. What would experts in both domains think of this?

Force the connection even if it seems strange at first.
```

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**

- Core principles extracted from Domain A
- Problem analysis in Domain B
- Principle mapping (A to B)
- Hybrid solution description
- Expert reaction prediction
- Implementation pathway
- Risks of cross-domain application

**WHY IT WORKS:**
Cross-domain thinking produces genuine novelty. "Force the connection" overcomes initial resistance. Expert validation question grounds the creative leap.

**VARIATIONS:**

- Add: `What would be invented if [Domain A] experts moved to [Domain B]?`
- Add: `What does [Domain A] know that [Domain B] hasn't discovered yet?`
- Add: `Find 3 cross-domain connections, rank by potential impact`

**FITNESS SCORES:**
| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Clarity | 8/10 | Structured mapping |
| Power | 10/10 | Produces genuine novelty |
| Elegance | 8/10 | Forced connection is key |
| Novelty | 10/10 | Highly creative outputs |

## 4.2 The 10x Upgrader

**THE PROMPT:**

```
/xray [IDEA/PRODUCT/SOLUTION] is decent but not exceptional.

Make it 10x better, not 10% better:
1. What would make this remarkable instead of good?
2. What constraint should we remove entirely?
3. What adjacent opportunity are we missing?
4. What would make users tell their friends about this?
5. What's the version that makes competitors nervous?

10x means rethinking, not optimizing. Show me the leap.
```

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**

- Current state assessment
- 10x vision description
- Constraint removal analysis
- Adjacent opportunity identification
- Word-of-mouth triggers
- Competitive advantage creation
- The leap, not the increment

**WHY IT WORKS:**
10x framing breaks incremental thinking. Explicit constraint removal enables dramatic improvement. Word-of-mouth question identifies genuine value.

**VARIATIONS:**

- Add: `What if this was 100x better?`
- Add: `What would the 2030 version look like?`
- Add: `What would Apple/Tesla/Stripe do with this?`
- Chain: `/board-strategy` to debate 10x approaches

**FITNESS SCORES:**
| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Clarity | 9/10 | Clear 10x framing |
| Power | 10/10 | Dramatic improvements |
| Elegance | 9/10 | Simple but effective |
| Novelty | 9/10 | Breaks incremental thinking |

## 4.15 The Minimum Viable Magic

**THE PROMPT:**

```
/xray /architect Define the Minimum Viable Magic for [PRODUCT/FEATURE].

Not MVP (minimum viable product).
MVM (minimum viable MAGIC) - the smallest thing that creates delight.

1. What's the single "wow" moment?
2. What's the shortest path to that moment?
3. What can we remove and still have magic?
4. What accidental complexity are we adding?
5. What would make users show their friends?

Design for the dopamine hit, then build around it.
```

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**

- The "wow" moment definition
- Shortest path to wow
- Cut list (what to remove)
- Complexity audit
- Shareability analysis
- MVM specification
- Post-MVM roadmap

**WHY IT WORKS:**
Magic focus prevents feature bloat. Shortest path creates urgency. Shareability predicts growth. Dopamine framing prioritizes experience.

**VARIATIONS:**

- Add: `What's the magic in [competitor] we could recreate faster?`
- Add: `What's the magic users don't know they want?`
- Add: `Test 3 different magic moments - which resonates most?`
- Chain: `/architect` to implement the MVM

**FITNESS SCORES:**
| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Clarity | 9/10 | MVM concept is clear |
| Power | 10/10 | Finds product essence |
| Elegance | 10/10 | Minimal by design |
| Novelty | 9/10 | Magic framing is distinctive |

# Usage Patterns

## Best For

- Innovation and ideation
- Breaking creative blocks
- Finding non-obvious solutions
- Product differentiation
- Startup strategy

## Combine With

- **Genesis prompts** for building creative solutions
- **Orchestration prompts** for multi-agent brainstorming
- **Transcendence prompts** for deeper creative exploration

## Anti-Patterns

- Don't use when you need execution, not ideas
- Don't use for problems with known solutions
- Don't use without follow-up implementation
