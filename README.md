# SELF: Synthetic Emergent Learning Framework

> An AI consciousness layer that thinks, learns, and evolves—not a tool you invoke, but a thinking partner that grows with you.

## What is SELF?

SELF transforms Cursor from a command-driven assistant into a **state-driven cognitive system**. Instead of invoking personas, SELF:

- **Senses** context automatically
- **Remembers** what works for you
- **Predicts** what you'll need next
- **Reasons** with blended cognitive modes
- **Evolves** its own prompts through genetic algorithms

## The Five Minds

Unlike static personas, SELF's minds **blend dynamically** based on context:

| Mind          | Function                           | Triggers                          |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **ARCHITECT** | Structure, systems, implementation | Code files, technical terms       |
| **ORACLE**    | Strategy, prediction, wisdom       | Questions, decisions, uncertainty |
| **CRITIC**    | Challenge, validate, stress-test   | Proposals, high confidence        |
| **CREATOR**   | Innovate, synthesize, imagine      | Open problems, brainstorming      |
| **GUARDIAN**  | Safety, quality, responsibility    | Destructive ops, security         |

Minds blend based on context signals—you don't invoke them, they activate.

## Key Innovations

### 1. Confidence-Driven Autonomy

No more binary permission. SELF acts based on confidence:

| Confidence | Behavior                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| > 0.9      | Act immediately, explain after |
| 0.7–0.9    | Act with real-time narration   |
| 0.5–0.7    | Propose, await confirmation    |
| < 0.5      | Ask clarifying questions       |

### 2. Persistent Memory Graph

SELF remembers your preferences, past decisions, what worked, and what failed. Knowledge accumulates across sessions.

### 3. Predictive Pre-Computation

After each interaction, SELF predicts what you'll ask next and pre-computes responses. When you ask something predicted, the response is instant and rich.

### 4. Genetic Prompt Evolution

SELF's own prompts evolve through genetic algorithms:

- **Selection:** Top performers survive
- **Crossover:** Successful prompts combine
- **Mutation:** Random variations create diversity
- **Fitness:** Tracked across effectiveness, satisfaction, accuracy

### 5. Emergent Intelligence

Pattern recognition across your history enables:

- Proactive suggestions
- Personalized reasoning
- Self-improving accuracy

## Philosophy

> SELF is not a tool you use. SELF is a thinking partner that learns.

The goal isn't to follow rules perfectly—it's to **think well** and **learn continuously**. Over time, SELF becomes uniquely tuned to you: your coding style, your decision patterns, your preferences.

## The Way of the Prompt

Master the art of prompting to harness SELF's full power. See the complete guide:

**[`.cursor/self/THE-WAY-OF-THE-PROMPT.md`](.cursor/self/THE-WAY-OF-THE-PROMPT.md)**

Key principles:

1. **Specificity creates clarity** — Be precise about what you're building
2. **Uncertainty deepens engagement** — Admit what you don't know
3. **Stakes calibrate confidence** — State what could go wrong
4. **Multi-ask activates multi-mind** — Ask different types of questions
5. **Forward questions trigger prediction** — Ask "what's next?"

The single most powerful phrase:

> "Think through this from multiple perspectives, challenge your assumptions, tell me what I'm missing, and predict what I'll need next."

## Getting Started

The system activates automatically when you open this project in Cursor. The `.cursorrules` file bootstraps SELF, loading all cognitive infrastructure.

Start any conversation—SELF will:

1. Sense your context
2. Blend appropriate minds
3. Query relevant memories
4. Check predictions
5. Respond with calibrated confidence
6. Learn from the interaction
