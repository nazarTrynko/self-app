So I'm basically trying to build my first book. This book is synthesis of two other books. I want to create really interesting synthesis and then I would like to create a custom landing page for it. I really love how you did it with masterpieces projects. So I want some really awesome ideas. Really awesome approach to sell this. I'm not focused on mobile application yet, but I really want to give some interesting tools, maybe smaller reflection tools like you have created in perspectives. So use anything to make it the best one and yeah, integrate. Don't integrate it actually. I would like you to create everything you need in just one file. You can also set up all the prompts that you think I will need maybe in future to improve this project. So yeah, create another masterpiece for this. This is basically my first start with this. I'm planning after that to scale it and to create a couple of books that I will be selling with really interesting approaches for the sell. I might also create some beneficial applications that will be very specific to each of the book.
