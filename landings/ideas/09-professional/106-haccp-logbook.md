## One-Liner

Offline food-safety logs with photo proof, corrective actions, and inspection-ready exports.

## Problem

Small kitchens fail inspections because critical control point logs are inconsistent, lost, or not tied to proof.

## Solution

Guided HACCP checks (temps, cleaning, storage) with photo evidence and corrective action records, exported as a single audit packet.

## Target User

Independent restaurants, food trucks, commissary kitchens.

## Key Features

- HACCP templates + customizable checkpoints
- Scheduled reminders + missed-check escalation
- Photo proof + notes per check
- Corrective action workflow + accountability
- PDF audit pack export (daily/weekly/monthly)

## Monetization

**Model:** Subscription
**Price:** $12.99/mo or $79/yr
**Strategy:** Free trial; paid unlocks audit packs and multiple locations.

**Our Edge:** Offline-first + inspection-aligned exports + corrective action rigor.

## Development Estimate

**Complexity:** Medium
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks
**Key Challenges:** Template design, reminders UX, reporting
