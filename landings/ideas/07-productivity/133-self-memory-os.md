## One-Liner

Your private memory graph for decisions, prompts, outcomes, and lessons—no cloud required.

## Problem

People repeat mistakes because their learning isn’t indexed; notes are linear and hard to review.

## Solution

Capture “episodes” (decision + context + outcome), link them into a graph, and run review rituals that surface patterns.

## Target User

Founders, makers, students, knowledge workers who want compounding learning.

## Key Features

- Episode capture (context, decision, outcome, lesson)
- Linking + tags + lightweight graph view
- Review prompts (weekly/monthly retrospective)
- Powerful offline search + saved queries
- Export: JSON/Markdown for portability

## Monetization

**Model:** One-time
**Price:** $29.99
**Strategy:** Market as privacy-first alternative to cloud PKM tools.
