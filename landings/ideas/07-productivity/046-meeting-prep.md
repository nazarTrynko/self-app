## One-Liner

Meeting preparation and notes companion—agenda templates, participant research, and follow-up tracking in one place.

## Problem

Meetings are often unproductive due to poor preparation. Notes get scattered. Follow-ups are forgotten. No tool focuses specifically on the meeting lifecycle: prepare → conduct → follow up.

## Solution

A dedicated meeting companion that helps prepare agendas, capture notes during meetings, track action items, and ensure follow-ups happen—all organized by meeting and completely offline.
