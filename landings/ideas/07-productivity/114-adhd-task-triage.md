# ADHD Task Triage (Evidence-Based)

**ID:** 114
**Category:** Productivity
**Tier:** Premium ($10-50)
**APIs:** Local DB, Timers, Notifications
**Offline:** Full

---

## One-Liner

Turn overwhelm into a tiny “next action” queue with timed help and proof-of-progress.

## Problem

ADHD users often fail not from lack of lists, but from inability to triage and start.

## Solution

Capture everything, auto-triage into “next actions,” run tiny timed sprints, and build a visible trail of wins.

## Target User

Adults with ADHD, students, anyone overwhelmed by task volume.

## Key Features

- Capture inbox + friction tagging (“stuck because…“)
- Triage rules engine (effort, urgency, energy)
- Timed “start sprint” with gentle prompts
- Progress artifacts (weekly wins card)
- Review ritual + backlog pruning

## Monetization

**Model:** One-time
**Price:** $14.99
**Strategy:** Community launches in ADHD/productivity spaces; strong before/after messaging.

## Visualization Concept

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                     │
│     [Inbox] → [Next Action] → [Sprint│
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Technical Notes

**Primary APIs:**
- Notifications: reminders and sprints
- Local database: tasks + rules

**Offline Strategy:**
Local-only task store; optional export as CSV.

**Data Handling:**
No accounts; no analytics by default.

## Competition & Differentiation

**Existing Solutions:** To-do apps; most don’t solve triage and start friction.
**Our Edge:** Triage + start engine + emotional progress artifacts.

## Development Estimate

**Complexity:** High
**Timeline:** 3 weeks
**Key Challenges:** Behavioral UX, rule tuning, avoiding feature creep
