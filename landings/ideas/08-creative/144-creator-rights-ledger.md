# Creator Rights Ledger (Offline)

**ID:** 144
**Category:** Creative
**Tier:** Premium ($10-50)
**APIs:** Files, Local encryption, PDF
**Offline:** Full

---

## One-Liner

Track creations, licenses, collaborators, and proof in a private offline ledger.

## Problem

Creators struggle to prove ownership/terms later because drafts, dates, and agreements are scattered.

## Solution

Record each creation with attachments and rights metadata, then export a “rights packet” for disputes or licensing.

## Target User

Designers, musicians, writers, photographers, indie creators.

## Key Features

- Creation entries with attachments (drafts, stems, exports)
- License terms + collaborator roles
- Milestone timeline + provenance notes
- Export rights packet (PDF + attachments)
- Encrypted vault + biometric lock

## Monetization

**Model:** One-time
**Price:** $19.99
**Strategy:** Creator communities; emphasize privacy and provenance.

## Visualization Concept

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                     │
│     [Create Entry] → [Attach Drafts] │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Technical Notes

**Primary APIs:**
- Files: import attachments
- Local encryption: protect ledger

**Offline Strategy:**
Encrypted local ledger; exports offline.

**Data Handling:**
No cloud; user-controlled exports only.

## Competition & Differentiation

**Existing Solutions:** Generic cloud storage and note apps.
**Our Edge:** Rights-first schema + export packets + provenance UX.

## Development Estimate

**Complexity:** High
**Timeline:** 3 weeks
**Key Challenges:** Schema design, export formatting, secure storage UX
