## One-Liner

Voice-record your dreams upon waking, get AI-powered pattern analysis, and discover recurring themes in your subconscious.

Dreams fade within minutes of waking. Writing is too slow and wakes you up fully. Dream journals require consistency and self-analysis to find patterns.

## Solution

Mumble your dream into your phone half-asleep—it transcribes and analyzes. Over time, AI identifies recurring symbols, themes, and patterns in your dreams.
