## One-Liner

A personal mythology system that helps you author, strengthen, and evolve your life narrative—integrating experiences into meaningful stories that build resilience, purpose, and a coherent sense of identity.

## Problem

Identity is constructed through narrative. Without intentional story-making, life experiences remain fragmented, setbacks feel meaningless, and identity becomes reactive rather than authored. Narrative therapy and life review interventions have powerful effects, but are typically only accessible through expensive therapy. Most people never integrate their experiences into coherent, empowering life stories.

## Solution

A guided life narrative construction system that helps you identify core themes, integrate difficult experiences, recognize growth patterns, articulate values and purpose, and continuously author a life story that provides meaning, resilience, and direction.

## Target User

- People in life transitions seeking meaning (midlife, retirement, divorce)
- Trauma survivors integrating experiences
- Recent graduates constructing adult identity
- Professionals seeking clarity on purpose and direction
- Therapists wanting tools for client narrative work
- Writers working on memoir or personal essays
- Anyone feeling their life lacks coherent meaning
- People approaching end of life wanting legacy

## Key Features

- **Life Chapter Structure**: Organize life into meaningful chapters and arcs
- **Theme Discovery**: AI-assisted identification of recurring life themes
- **Experience Integration**: Guided protocols for meaning-making from events
- **Redemption Narratives**: Transform setbacks into growth stories
- **Value Archaeology**: Discover values through life pattern analysis
- **Future Authoring**: Write forward-looking narrative (Peterson-inspired)
- **Photo-Memory Integration**: Connect photos to narrative moments
- **Turning Point Mapping**: Identify and articulate pivotal moments
- **Generativity Prompts**: Create legacy statements and wisdom distillation
- **Narrative Coherence Score**: Assess and improve story integration
- **Export to Memoir**: Generate prose from structured narrative
- **Family Story Connection**: Link personal narrative to ancestral context

## Monetization

**Model:** One-time purchase
**Price:** $49.99 (full system with export and all protocols)
**Strategy:**
- Life coaching certification partnerships
- Retirement planning industry integration
- Memoir writing workshop affiliations
- Grief counselor referral network
- University life design course integration

## Technical Notes

**Primary APIs:**
- Speech Framework: Voice-based narrative entry
- NaturalLanguage: Theme extraction and sentiment analysis
- Core ML: Pattern recognition across life stories
- Photos: Timeline integration with narrative
- Calendar: Event correlation with life chapters

**Offline Strategy:**
All narrative processing on-device. Life story database encrypted locally. Theme analysis runs locally. No cloud dependency.

**Data Handling:**
- Life narratives: Maximum encryption, device-only
- Photos referenced: Not copied, only linked
- Analysis: All local ML processing
- Export: User-controlled formats
- This is the most private data imaginable

## Competition & Differentiation

**Existing Solutions:**
- Journaling apps (daily focus, no life-span view)
- Memoir software (writing tools, no meaning-making)
- Therapy apps (symptom focus, not narrative)
- Life review tools (legacy focus, not active authoring)

**Our Edge:**
- Active life authoring, not passive recording
- AI-assisted theme and pattern discovery
- Integration protocols for difficult experiences
- Future authoring for direction-setting
- Narrative therapy principles made accessible
- Coherence scoring and improvement

## Development Estimate

**Complexity:** High
**Timeline:** 16-20 weeks
**Key Challenges:**
- Theme extraction from life stories
- Guiding redemption narrative construction sensitively
- Measuring "narrative coherence" meaningfully
- Handling trauma material appropriately
- Making philosophical/existential content accessible
- Export formatting for readable memoir

## Council Assessment

**🏗️ ARCHITECT:** "NLP for theme extraction is achievable. The meaning-making protocols need careful design with psychology input. The life map visualization is a significant UX challenge."

**🔮 ORACLE:** "Meaning-making is a fundamental human need. Life review has strong research backing for wellbeing. The timing is good—existential concerns are prominent post-pandemic."

**⚖️ CRITIC:** "This is deep psychological work. Risk of superficial treatment of serious material. Need clinical advisors. Some experiences require professional support, not an app."

**🎨 CREATOR:** "The 'life chapters' metaphor is powerful. Theme discovery is genuinely valuable and shareable. The future authoring feature connects to goal-setting in practical way."

**🛡️ GUARDIAN:** "Life narratives are the most sensitive data possible. Encryption and privacy must be absolute. Include warnings about when professional support is needed. Never store in cloud."

**Verdict:** GO — Unique positioning, profound potential value, requires clinical consultation
