                        Your attention is your deepest vote. Not what you say matters, 
                        not what you believe should matter—what actually draws your 
                        focus when no one is watching. That's the signal.

                        Every other tool tells you where to go. 
                        The Compass reveals where you're already going. 
                        Not direction through decision—direction through attention.

                        The goal isn't to pursue every pull blindly. 
                        It's to understand what your attention is telling you. 
                        Then you can choose whether to follow, redirect, or resist—
                        but at least you'll know the truth.

                    If you removed all obligation—financial, social, familial—
                    and could build a life purely around what naturally draws you, 
                    what would that look like? 
                    The answer that arises is your compass reading. 
                    The distance from your current life is your alignment gap.
