                    <h3>The Shadow</h3>
                    <p>
                        Jung called it the shadow—the parts of yourself you pushed away. 
                        But suppressed doesn't mean gone. These parts operate from the dark, 
                        influencing you in ways you don't understand until you face them.

                    <p>
                        Every other tool helps you become more. 
                        The Exile helps you reclaim what you already were. 
                        Integration isn't adding—it's un-rejecting.

                    <p>
                        The goal isn't to act on every exiled impulse. 
                        It's to stop spending energy suppressing them. 
                        Acknowledgment is integration. 
                        Wholeness is the result.
