                        We track money obsessively but ignore the currencies that matter more: 
                        time, energy, relationships, identity, potential. 
                        True wealth accounting includes all the ledgers.

                        Every other tool tracks what you gain. 
                        The Price tracks what you spend—the hidden costs of every decision. 
                        Because a choice isn't free just because no invoice arrives.

                        Consciousness about cost is consciousness about value.
