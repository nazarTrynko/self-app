                        Supportive feedback feels good. But it doesn't make you stronger. 
                        The muscle grows through resistance, not rest. 
                        The mind sharpens through challenge, not agreement.

                        You have weaknesses you can't see. Assumptions you don't know you're making. 
                        Flaws in your plans invisible to you. Someone needs to find them 
                        before reality does—and reality is not kind.

                        The Adversary doesn't oppose you out of malice. 
                        It opposes you because it believes you can be stronger. 
                        True respect is challenge. True love is truth, even when it hurts.

                    <p>
                        In the Catholic Church, the "Devil's Advocate" argued against 
                        sainthood candidates—to ensure only the truly worthy were canonized. 
                        The Adversary serves the same function for your ideas.

                    <p>
                        Every other AI is helpful. The Adversary is oppositional. 
                        Not to harm—to strengthen. The difference between a trainer 
                        and a friend is that the trainer pushes you beyond comfort.

                        that you're not being challenged enough. Seek worthy opponents. 
                        They are the greatest gifts.

                    Think of your most cherished belief. Now imagine someone 
                    far more intelligent than you, who has studied this belief deeply, 
                    and has concluded you're wrong. What would they say?
