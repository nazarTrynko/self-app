                    <p>
                        Pain is raw material. Left unprocessed, it festers. 
                        But with intentional attention, it can be transformed into 
                        something useful—understanding, compassion, strength, wisdom.

                    <h3>The Inversion</h3>
                    <p>
                        Every other tool helps you avoid pain. 
                        The Harvest helps you metabolize it. 
                        Not to justify what happened—to extract value from what cannot be undone.

                    <p>
                        Your scars can become your gifts. 
                        The wisdom you earn through suffering can help others. 
                        The wound that almost broke you can become the thing that heals someone else.

                    Think of something that hurt you deeply. 
                    Now think of who you became because of it. 
                    Is there any wisdom you have now that you wouldn't have without the wound? 
                    That wisdom is the harvest. 
                    It doesn't justify the pain. 
                    It redeems it.
