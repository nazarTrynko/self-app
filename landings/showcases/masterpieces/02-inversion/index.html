                    <p>
                        Debate is about winning. Inversion is about understanding. 
                        When you can genuinely inhabit the opposing view, 
                        you transcend the conflict. There's no enemy—only different vantage points.

                    <p>
                        Every other tool helps you strengthen your position. 
                        This one asks you to genuinely abandon it—temporarily. 
                        The goal isn't to change your mind. It's to understand 
                        how you could have a different mind.

                        Could you argue the opposing position so well that 
                        someone who holds it would think you believe it? 
                        If not, you don't yet understand it. Keep practicing.

                    The answer reveals something about both of you.
