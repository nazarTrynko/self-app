                    <h3>The Separation</h3>
                    <p>
                        Most people are fused with their thoughts. They believe they ARE the voice in their head. 
                        But the simple act of noticing a thought proves there's a "you" separate from it. 
                        Who is doing the noticing?

                    <h3>The Inversion</h3>
                    <p>
                        Every other tool helps you think better. 
                        The Witness helps you see that you don't have to think at all. 
                        The observer is always there, beneath the noise, 
                        waiting to be discovered.

                    <p>
                        For the next hour, label every thought that arises. 
                        "Planning." "Judging." "Worrying." 
                        The label creates distance. The distance creates freedom. 
                        You are not your thoughts.
