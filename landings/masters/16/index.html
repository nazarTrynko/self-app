                    <h3>The Stoic Practice</h3>
                    <p>
                        Marcus Aurelius began each day contemplating death. 
                        Not to despair, but to live fully. "You could leave life right now. 
                        Let that determine what you do and say and think."

                    <h3>The Inversion</h3>
                    <p>
                        Every other tool helps you plan for the future. 
                        The Memento uses the end of all futures to illuminate the present. 
                        What would you do today if you knew it was finite?

                    <h3>Not Morbid—Clarifying</h3>
                    <p>
                        This isn't about fear or sadness. It's about cutting through 
                        the noise to what actually matters. Death is a gift—
                        it makes life precious.
