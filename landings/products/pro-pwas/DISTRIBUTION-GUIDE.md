### Reddit Post (r/Construction, r/Contractors)

**Title:** I'm building a quote app for contractors. Would you pay $45 one-time?

**Body:**
```
Hey fellow contractors,

I've been frustrated watching good contractors lose jobs because they say "I'll email you a quote" while a competitor quotes on-site.

So I'm building Quote Builder Pro - a phone app that lets you:
- Create professional estimates in 2 minutes
- Get digital signatures right there
- Works completely offline (job sites have no signal)
- One-time $45 purchase, no monthly fees

The idea is you can quote while standing in the client's kitchen, get their signature, and leave with the job secured.

**Question for you:**
1. Would you actually pay $45 for this?
2. What features would make it a "must-have"?
3. What similar tools do you use now?

Not selling anything yet - just validating if this is worth building.

Thanks!
```

Quick question for contractors 👷

I'm building a phone app to create professional quotes ON-SITE instead of "I'll email you later."

- Works offline (no signal needed)
- Digital signatures
- Professional PDFs
- One-time $45 (no monthly)

Would you use something like this? What's missing?

Not selling - just figuring out if this is worth finishing.

### Reddit Post (r/couriersofreddit, r/doordash)

**Title:** Would you pay $15 one-time for an app that prevents "I never received it" disputes?

**Body:**
```
Fellow drivers,

We've all had the customer who claims they never got their delivery. Then you're out the cost, your rating drops, and you have no proof.

I'm building Delivery Proof - a simple app that captures:
- Photo of delivery
- GPS location (proves you were there)
- Timestamp (proves when)
- Customer signature (if they're there)
- Generates PDF proof if there's ever a dispute

Works completely offline (dead zones are real).
One-time $15 purchase, not a subscription.

**Questions:**
1. Would $15 be worth it to never lose a dispute again?
2. What features would make this essential?
3. How often do you deal with false non-delivery claims?

Just validating if this is worth building. Not selling yet.
```

### Short-Form Post

```
🚗 Delivery drivers: Would you pay $15 one-time for an app that captures photo + GPS + timestamp proof for EVERY delivery?

Building something to stop "I never received it" disputes cold.

Worth it or nah?
```

### Reddit Post (r/HVAC, r/Plumbing, r/electricians)

**Title:** How do you protect yourself from "that scratch wasn't there before" claims?

**Body:**
```
Had another customer claim I scratched their counter while working on their garbage disposal. I know it was already there, but I have no proof.

So I'm building Pre-Job Photo Vault - an app to:
- Document every existing scratch/dent/damage BEFORE starting work
- Photos are timestamped and GPS-locked
- Can't be edited after "sealing" the documentation
- Generates PDF if there's ever a dispute

$19 one-time, works offline, runs on any phone.

**Questions:**
1. How often does this happen to you?
2. What do you currently do to protect yourself?
3. Would $19 be worth it for peace of mind?

Just trying to figure out if other techs need this too.
```

### Moving Company Forum Post

```
Moving companies: How do you document existing damage before a move?

Building an app that lets you walk through, photo every scratch/dent, lock it with timestamp + GPS, and have bulletproof proof if a customer claims you damaged something.

$19 one-time. No subscription.

Is this something you'd use?

### Reddit Post (r/HVAC)

**Title:** How do you document service calls to prevent "you never fixed it" callbacks?

**Body:**
```
Independent HVAC tech here. Getting tired of:

1. Fixing something
2. Customer calls 2 weeks later: "It's broken again, you didn't fix it right"
3. Going back for free because I have no proof I actually fixed it

Building Service Ticket Pro to:
- Photo before AND after every repair
- Quick checklist of work done
- Customer signs off: "I verified the AC is working"
- Timestamped, locked, PDF-ready

$25 one-time. Works offline. All data stays on your phone.

**Questions:**
1. How often do callback disputes happen to you?
2. What do you do now to document your work?
3. Would $25 be worth preventing even ONE free callback?

Validating if other techs need this. Not selling yet.
```

### Trade Forum Post

```
Fellow techs: What's your system for documenting service calls?

I'm building an app for:
- Before/after photos
- Service checklist
- Customer signature ("I confirm unit is working")
- PDF for your records

$25 one-time. The idea is one prevented callback pays for it 6x over.

Anyone actually need this?

### Reddit Post (r/Construction, r/Contractors)

**Title:** Contractors doing T&M work: How do you prevent hour disputes at invoice time?

**Body:**
```
Anyone else tired of:

Client: "I didn't authorize 20 hours of work!"
You: "But... I was here for 20 hours..."
Client: "Prove it."

Building T&M Tracker to fix this:
- One-tap time tracking (start when you arrive, stop when you leave)
- Material logging with photos
- **Milestone sign-offs**: "Demo complete: 6 hours" → client signs
- Invoice-ready PDF with every signature

So when they say "I never approved that," you show their signature on each phase.

$29 one-time. Works offline.

**Questions:**
1. How often do T&M disputes happen?
2. What's your current tracking system?
3. Would milestone sign-offs actually prevent disputes?

Just validating if this solves a real problem.
```

## Handling Objections

Common objections and responses:

**"I just use my camera roll"**
→ "Totally works! The difference is timestamps that can't be edited, GPS proof, and organized by job so you can find it when there's a dispute 6 months later."

**"$X is too expensive"**
→ "I hear you. What price would make sense? I'm trying to figure out the right number."

**"I'd never pay for this"**
→ "Appreciate the honesty! What would you need to pay for a tool like this?"

**"I use ServiceTitan/Jobber/etc."**
→ "Those are great! This is for folks who don't need a $100/mo full system, just the documentation part."

**"Just build it and see"**
→ "Would you pre-order if I did? That's the real validation."
